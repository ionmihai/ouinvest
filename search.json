If inflation erodes the value of money, your real return is less than your nominal return.\nThe approximate relationship is simple:\n\\[r_r \\approx r_n - i\\]\nwhere \\(r_r\\) is the real rate, \\(r_n\\) is the nominal rate, and \\(i\\) is the inflation rate.\nThe exact relationship is:\n\\[1 + r_r = \\frac{1 + r_n}{1 + i} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_r = \\frac{r_n - i}{1 + i}\\]\nThe approximation works well when inflation is low but overstates the real rate when inflation is high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fisher Equation\n\n\n\nIrving Fisher argued that nominal rates should increase one-for-one with expected inflation: \\[r_n = r_r + E(i)\\] This implies that when real rates are stable, changes in nominal rates predict changes in inflation.\n\n\n\nExample: Real Rate CalculationSolution\n\n\nA 1-year CD offers a nominal rate of 8%. You expect inflation to be 5% over the coming year. What is your expected real rate of return using both the approximation and the exact formula?\n\n\nApproximation: \\[r_r \\approx 8\\% - 5\\% = 3\\%\\]\nExact formula: \\[r_r = \\frac{0.08 - 0.05}{1 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.03}{1.05} = 0.0286 = 2.86\\%\\]\nThe approximation overstates the real rate by 14 basis points (0.14%)."
