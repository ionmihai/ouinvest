    "section": "2 Portfolio Weights and Realized Returns",
    "text": "2 Portfolio Weights and Realized Returns\nEvery portfolio can be completely described by answering two questions: What assets are in the portfolio? And what fraction of the portfolio’s value does each asset represent? These fractions are called portfolio weights, and they are the starting point for all portfolio calculations.\nConsider a portfolio containing \\(N\\) assets. Let \\(M_i\\) represent the market value of asset \\(i\\) at the beginning of some measurement period—this is simply the price per share multiplied by the number of shares held. The weight of asset \\(i\\) in the portfolio is defined as:\n\\[w_i = \\frac{M_i}{M_1 + M_2 + \\cdots + M_N}\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), \\(M_i\\) is the market value of asset \\(i\\), and the denominator is the total portfolio value. Notice that weights must always sum to one: if you add up every asset’s fraction of the total, you get the whole portfolio.\nOnce we know the weights, calculating the portfolio’s return over a period becomes straightforward. If asset \\(i\\) earns a return of \\(R_i\\) during the period, the portfolio return is:\n\\[R_P = w_1 R_1 + w_2 R_2 + \\cdots + w_N R_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i R_i\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the portfolio return, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), and \\(R_i\\) is the return of asset \\(i\\). This formula tells us that the portfolio return is a weighted average of the individual asset returns. An asset that represents 60% of your portfolio contributes 60% of its return to the portfolio return, while an asset representing only 10% contributes proportionally less.\nOne subtlety deserves attention: weights change over time as asset prices change. After one period of returns, the market values of your holdings will have shifted, and with them the weights. If one stock doubles while another stays flat, the first stock now represents a larger fraction of your portfolio. This means that calculating multi-period returns requires updating weights at the end of each period before computing the next period’s return.\nExample 1\nSuppose today Meta (META) is selling for $200 per share and Netflix (NFLX) is selling for $400 per share. You buy two shares of META and one share of NFLX. Over the next month, META has a return of 10% and NFLX has a return of 20%. The month after that, META has a return of -10% and NFLX has a return of -20%. What will be the return of the portfolio over each month? What will the return of your portfolio be over this entire two-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate initial portfolio values and weights\nAt the start of Month 1:\n\nMETA: 2 shares × $200 = $400\nNFLX: 1 share × $400 = $400\nTotal portfolio value: $800\n\nInitial weights:\n\n\\(w_{META} = \\$400 / \\$800 = 0.50\\) (50%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = \\$400 / \\$800 = 0.50\\) (50%)\n\nStep 2: Calculate Month 1 return\n\\[R_{P,1} = w_{META} \\times R_{META} + w_{NFLX} \\times R_{NFLX}\\] \\[R_{P,1} = 0.50 \\times 10\\% + 0.50 \\times 20\\% = 5\\% + 10\\% = 15\\%\\]\nStep 3: Calculate new portfolio values and weights for Month 2\nAt the end of Month 1 (start of Month 2):\n\nMETA value: $400 × (1 + 0.10) = $440\nNFLX value: $400 × (1 + 0.20) = $480\nTotal portfolio value: $920\n\nNew weights:\n\n\\(w_{META} = \\$440 / \\$920 = 0.478\\) (47.8%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = \\$480 / \\$920 = 0.522\\) (52.2%)\n\nStep 4: Calculate Month 2 return using new weights\n\\[R_{P,2} = 0.478 \\times (-10\\%) + 0.522 \\times (-20\\%)\\] \\[R_{P,2} = -4.78\\% + (-10.44\\%) = -15.22\\%\\]\nStep 5: Calculate two-month total return\nThe total two-month return compounds the monthly returns:\n\\[R_{total} = (1 + R_{P,1}) \\times (1 + R_{P,2}) - 1\\] \\[R_{total} = (1 + 0.15) \\times (1 - 0.1522) - 1\\] \\[R_{total} = 1.15 \\times 0.8478 - 1 = 0.975 - 1 = -2.5\\%\\]\nAlternatively, we can verify using ending and beginning portfolio values:\n\nFinal META value: $440 × (1 - 0.10) = $396\nFinal NFLX value: $480 × (1 - 0.20) = $384\nFinal portfolio value: $780\n\n\\[R_{total} = \\frac{\\$780 - \\$800}{\\$800} = -2.5\\%\\]\nSummary: Month 1 return = 15%, Month 2 return = -15.22%, Two-month total return = -2.5%"

    "text": "3 Portfolio Expected Returns\nWhile realized returns tell us what happened in the past, investment decisions require thinking about the future. The expected return of a portfolio represents our best estimate of what the portfolio will earn, on average, going forward.\nThe formula for expected portfolio return has the same elegant structure as the formula for realized returns—it is simply a weighted average:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2] + \\cdots + w_N E[R_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i E[R_i]\\]\nwhere \\(E[R_P]\\) is the expected portfolio return, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), and \\(E[R_i]\\) is the expected return of asset \\(i\\). This formula carries an important implication: you cannot create expected return out of thin air through clever portfolio construction. The portfolio’s expected return is bounded by the expected returns of its components. If all your assets have expected returns between 5% and 12%, your portfolio’s expected return must also fall within that range.\nIn practice, we typically estimate expected returns using historical average returns, though more sophisticated approaches exist. The sample mean of historical returns provides an estimate of what we might expect going forward, with the important caveat that past performance does not guarantee future results.\nFor portfolios with just two or three assets, the formula simplifies to familiar forms that are worth memorizing:\n\n\n\nPortfolio Size\nExpected Return Formula\n\n\n\n\nTwo assets\n\\(E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2]\\)\n\n\nThree assets\n\\(E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2] + w_3 E[R_3]\\)\n\n\n\nExample 2\nSuppose over the past three months META had returns of 10%, 10%, and -8%, and NFLX had returns of 20%, -10%, and -1%.

    "section": "4 Correlation and Covariance Between Return Series",
    "text": "4 Correlation and Covariance Between Return Series\nBefore we can understand portfolio risk, we need to understand how different assets move together. Do they tend to rise and fall at the same time, or do they move independently, or do they actually move in opposite directions? The statistical measures that capture this co-movement are covariance and correlation, and they turn out to be the key ingredients that make diversification possible.\nThe covariance between two assets measures whether their returns tend to move in the same direction (positive covariance), opposite directions (negative covariance), or show no consistent pattern (covariance near zero). Given historical returns for assets A and B—denoted \\(R_1^A, R_2^A, \\ldots, R_N^A\\) and \\(R_1^B, R_2^B, \\ldots, R_N^B\\)—the sample covariance is calculated as:\n\\[Cov_{A,B} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N}(R_t^A - \\bar{R}^A)(R_t^B - \\bar{R}^B)}{N-1}\\]\nwhere \\(Cov_{A,B}\\) is the sample covariance between assets A and B, \\(R_t^A\\) and \\(R_t^B\\) are the returns of assets A and B in period \\(t\\), \\(\\bar{R}^A\\) and \\(\\bar{R}^B\\) are the sample means (average returns), and \\(N\\) is the number of observations. We divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\) to correct for the bias that arises when estimating a population parameter from a sample.\nThe intuition behind this formula is elegant: for each time period, we ask whether both assets were above their average (product is positive), both below their average (product is also positive), or on opposite sides of their averages (product is negative). Averaging these products tells us the typical co-movement pattern.\nWhile covariance captures the direction and magnitude of co-movement, its units are difficult to interpret (percent squared). The correlation coefficient solves this by normalizing the covariance:\n\\[Corr_{A,B} = \\frac{Cov_{A,B}}{\\sigma^A \\sigma^B}\\]\nwhere \\(Corr_{A,B}\\) is the correlation coefficient, \\(Cov_{A,B}\\) is the covariance, and \\(\\sigma^A\\) and \\(\\sigma^B\\) are the sample standard deviations of assets A and B.

    "text": "5 Portfolio Total Risk\nNow we arrive at the central insight of portfolio theory: how risk combines across assets. Unlike expected returns, which combine as a simple weighted average, portfolio risk depends on the correlations between assets in complex and often counterintuitive ways.\nThe variance of a portfolio’s return is given by:\n\\[Var[R_P] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 Var[R_i] + \\sum_{i \\neq j} w_i w_j Cov[R_i, R_j]\\]\nwhere \\(Var[R_P]\\) is the portfolio variance, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), \\(Var[R_i]\\) is the variance of asset \\(i\\)’s returns, and \\(Cov[R_i, R_j]\\) is the covariance between assets \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). The portfolio standard deviation (total risk) is simply the square root of the variance: \\(\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{Var[R_P]}\\).\nThis formula has two distinct components. The first summation captures the individual risk contributions—each asset’s variance, scaled by its squared weight. The second summation captures the interaction effects—how pairs of assets move together, weighted by the product of their weights. The factor of 2 appears because each pair \\((i,j)\\) contributes twice (once for \\(i,j\\) and once for \\(j,i\\)), and the formula accounts for both.\nFor a two-asset portfolio, the formula simplifies to:\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_1^2 Var[R_1] + w_2^2 Var[R_2] + 2w_1 w_2 Cov[R_1, R_2]\\]\nFor a three-asset portfolio:\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_1^2 Var[R_1] + w_2^2 Var[R_2] + w_3^2 Var[R_3] + 2w_1 w_2 Cov[R_1, R_2] + 2w_1 w_3 Cov[R_1, R_3] + 2w_2 w_3 Cov[R_2, R_3]\\]\nThe covariance terms are where the magic of diversification happens. When covariances are less than perfect (which is almost always the case), the portfolio variance will be less than the weighted average of the individual variances. In the extreme case where two assets have a correlation of -1, you can construct a portfolio with zero variance—a risk-free portfolio from risky assets! While such perfect negative correlations are rare in practice, even modest positive correlations below 1 provide meaningful diversification benefits.\nThis is why covariance is so important: it determines how much risk you can eliminate through diversification. The lower the covariances between your assets, the more your portfolio’s risk will fall below what you might naively expect from averaging the individual risks.\nExample 4\nSuppose over the past three months META had returns of 10%, 10%, and -8%, and NFLX had returns of 20%, -10%, and -1%. Today, you invest $1,000 in META and $4,000 in NFLX. What is the total risk of your portfolio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Identify portfolio weights (from Example 2)\n\n\\(w_{META} = 0.20\\) (20%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = 0.80\\) (80%)\n\nStep 2: Recall or calculate variances (from Example 3)\n\n\\(Var^{META} = 0.0108\\)\n\\(Var^{NFLX} = 0.0237\\)\n\\(Cov_{META,NFLX} = 0.0036\\)\n\nStep 3: Apply the two-asset portfolio variance formula\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_{META}^2 \\times Var^{META} + w_{NFLX}^2 \\times Var^{NFLX} + 2 \\times w_{META} \\times w_{NFLX} \\times Cov_{META,NFLX}\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = (0.20)^2 \\times 0.0108 + (0.80)^2 \\times 0.0237 + 2 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.0036\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.04 \\times 0.0108 + 0.64 \\times 0.0237 + 0.32 \\times 0.0036\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.000432 + 0.015168 + 0.001152\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.016752\\]\nStep 4: Calculate portfolio standard deviation\n\\[\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{0.016752} = 0.1294 = 12.94\\%\\]\nStep 5: Verify diversification benefit\nLet’s compare to what the risk would be if we simply weighted the standard deviations:\nWeighted average of standard deviations: \\(0.20 \\times 10.39\\% + 0.80 \\times 15.39\\% = 2.08\\% + 12.31\\% = 14.39\\%\\)\nActual portfolio standard deviation: 12.94%\nThe portfolio standard deviation (12.94%) is less than the weighted average of individual standard deviations (14.39%), demonstrating the risk reduction benefit of diversification. This occurs because the correlation between META and NFLX is less than 1 (we calculated it as 0.225 in Example 3)."

    "text": "6 Key Takeaways\nPortfolio analysis builds on a simple foundation—weights determine how much each asset matters—but leads to profound insights about how risk and return combine. The return side is straightforward: a portfolio’s expected return is just a weighted average of its components’ expected returns. You cannot manufacture expected return through portfolio construction; you can only choose where to position yourself between your highest- and lowest-returning assets.\nRisk behaves very differently. While individual asset variances contribute to portfolio variance, so do the covariances between every pair of assets. This creates the possibility of diversification: when assets don’t move in perfect lockstep, combining them produces a portfolio less volatile than you might expect. The mathematics shows this clearly—the covariance terms in the portfolio variance formula can substantially reduce total risk when correlations are low.\nThis distinction between return (which averages simply) and risk (which depends on co-movement) is the central insight of modern portfolio theory. It explains why diversification is often called the only “free lunch” in finance: you can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return, simply by combining assets that don’t move together perfectly.\nRemember too that portfolios are dynamic. Weights change as prices change, meaning that multi-period calculations require updating weights after each period. A portfolio that starts with equal weights will drift toward overweighting winners and underweighting losers unless actively rebalanced."

This exceptional diversification benefit occurs because the correlation between X and Y is negative (-0.39), meaning the stocks tend to move in opposite directions, partially offsetting each other’s volatility."

    "section": "2 Portfolio Weights and Realized Returns",
    "text": "2 Portfolio Weights and Realized Returns\nEvery portfolio can be completely described by answering two questions: What assets are in the portfolio? And what fraction of the portfolio’s value does each asset represent? These fractions are called portfolio weights, and they are the starting point for all portfolio calculations.\nConsider a portfolio containing \\(N\\) assets. Let \\(M_i\\) represent the market value of asset \\(i\\) at the beginning of some measurement period—this is simply the price per share multiplied by the number of shares held. The weight of asset \\(i\\) in the portfolio is defined as:\n\\[w_i = \\frac{M_i}{M_1 + M_2 + \\cdots + M_N}\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), \\(M_i\\) is the market value of asset \\(i\\), and the denominator is the total portfolio value. Notice that weights must always sum to one: if you add up every asset’s fraction of the total, you get the whole portfolio.\nOnce we know the weights, calculating the portfolio’s return over a period becomes straightforward. If asset \\(i\\) earns a return of \\(R_i\\) during the period, the portfolio return is:\n\\[R_P = w_1 R_1 + w_2 R_2 + \\cdots + w_N R_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i R_i\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the portfolio return, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), and \\(R_i\\) is the return of asset \\(i\\). This formula tells us that the portfolio return is a weighted average of the individual asset returns. An asset that represents 60% of your portfolio contributes 60% of its return to the portfolio return, while an asset representing only 10% contributes proportionally less.\nOne subtlety deserves attention: weights change over time as asset prices change. After one period of returns, the market values of your holdings will have shifted, and with them the weights. If one stock doubles while another stays flat, the first stock now represents a larger fraction of your portfolio. This means that calculating multi-period returns requires updating weights at the end of each period before computing the next period’s return.\nExample 1\nSuppose today Meta (META) is selling for $200 per share and Netflix (NFLX) is selling for $400 per share. You buy two shares of META and one share of NFLX. Over the next month, META has a return of 10% and NFLX has a return of 20%. The month after that, META has a return of -10% and NFLX has a return of -20%. What will be the return of the portfolio over each month? What will the return of your portfolio be over this entire two-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate initial portfolio values and weights\nAt the start of Month 1:\n\nMETA: 2 shares × $200 = $400\nNFLX: 1 share × $400 = $400\nTotal portfolio value: $800\n\nInitial weights:\n\n\\(w_{META} = \\$400 / \\$800 = 0.50\\) (50%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = \\$400 / \\$800 = 0.50\\) (50%)\n\nStep 2: Calculate Month 1 return\n\\[R_{P,1} = w_{META} \\times R_{META} + w_{NFLX} \\times R_{NFLX}\\] \\[R_{P,1} = 0.50 \\times 10\\% + 0.50 \\times 20\\% = 5\\% + 10\\% = 15\\%\\]\nStep 3: Calculate new portfolio values and weights for Month 2\nAt the end of Month 1 (start of Month 2):\n\nMETA value: $400 × (1 + 0.10) = $440\nNFLX value: $400 × (1 + 0.20) = $480\nTotal portfolio value: $920\n\nNew weights:\n\n\\(w_{META} = \\$440 / \\$920 = 0.478\\) (47.8%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = \\$480 / \\$920 = 0.522\\) (52.2%)\n\nStep 4: Calculate Month 2 return using new weights\n\\[R_{P,2} = 0.478 \\times (-10\\%) + 0.522 \\times (-20\\%)\\] \\[R_{P,2} = -4.78\\% + (-10.44\\%) = -15.22\\%\\]\nStep 5: Calculate two-month total return\nThe total two-month return compounds the monthly returns:\n\\[R_{total} = (1 + R_{P,1}) \\times (1 + R_{P,2}) - 1\\] \\[R_{total} = (1 + 0.15) \\times (1 - 0.1522) - 1\\] \\[R_{total} = 1.15 \\times 0.8478 - 1 = 0.975 - 1 = -2.5\\%\\]\nAlternatively, we can verify using ending and beginning portfolio values:\n\nFinal META value: $440 × (1 - 0.10) = $396\nFinal NFLX value: $480 × (1 - 0.20) = $384\nFinal portfolio value: $780\n\n\\[R_{total} = \\frac{\\$780 - \\$800}{\\$800} = -2.5\\%\\]\nSummary: Month 1 return = 15%, Month 2 return = -15.22%, Two-month total return = -2.5%"

    "text": "3 Portfolio Expected Returns\nWhile realized returns tell us what happened in the past, investment decisions require thinking about the future. The expected return of a portfolio represents our best estimate of what the portfolio will earn, on average, going forward.\nThe formula for expected portfolio return has the same elegant structure as the formula for realized returns—it is simply a weighted average:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2] + \\cdots + w_N E[R_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i E[R_i]\\]\nwhere \\(E[R_P]\\) is the expected portfolio return, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), and \\(E[R_i]\\) is the expected return of asset \\(i\\). This formula carries an important implication: you cannot create expected return out of thin air through clever portfolio construction. The portfolio’s expected return is bounded by the expected returns of its components. If all your assets have expected returns between 5% and 12%, your portfolio’s expected return must also fall within that range.\nIn practice, we typically estimate expected returns using historical average returns, though more sophisticated approaches exist. The sample mean of historical returns provides an estimate of what we might expect going forward, with the important caveat that past performance does not guarantee future results.\nFor portfolios with just two or three assets, the formula simplifies to familiar forms that are worth memorizing:\n\n\n\nPortfolio Size\nExpected Return Formula\n\n\n\n\nTwo assets\n\\(E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2]\\)\n\n\nThree assets\n\\(E[R_P] = w_1 E[R_1] + w_2 E[R_2] + w_3 E[R_3]\\)\n\n\n\nExample 2\nSuppose over the past three months META had returns of 10%, 10%, and -8%, and NFLX had returns of 20%, -10%, and -1%. Today, you invest $1,000 in META and $4,000 in NFLX.

    "text": "4 Correlation and Covariance Between Return Series\nBefore we can understand portfolio risk, we need to understand how different assets move together. Do they tend to rise and fall at the same time, or do they move independently, or do they actually move in opposite directions? The statistical measures that capture this co-movement are covariance and correlation, and they turn out to be the key ingredients that make diversification possible.\nThe covariance between two assets measures whether their returns tend to move in the same direction (positive covariance), opposite directions (negative covariance), or show no consistent pattern (covariance near zero). Given historical returns for assets A and B—denoted \\(R_1^A, R_2^A, \\ldots, R_N^A\\) and \\(R_1^B, R_2^B, \\ldots, R_N^B\\)—the sample covariance is calculated as:\n\\[Cov_{A,B} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N}(R_t^A - \\bar{R}^A)(R_t^B - \\bar{R}^B)}{N-1}\\]\nwhere \\(Cov_{A,B}\\) is the sample covariance between assets A and B, \\(R_t^A\\) and \\(R_t^B\\) are the returns of assets A and B in period \\(t\\), \\(\\bar{R}^A\\) and \\(\\bar{R}^B\\) are the sample means (average returns), and \\(N\\) is the number of observations. We divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\) to correct for the bias that arises when estimating a population parameter from a sample.\nThe intuition behind this formula is elegant: for each time period, we ask whether both assets were above their average (product is positive), both below their average (product is also positive), or on opposite sides of their averages (product is negative). Averaging these products tells us the typical co-movement pattern.\nWhile covariance captures the direction and magnitude of co-movement, its units are difficult to interpret (percent squared). The correlation coefficient solves this by normalizing the covariance:\n\\[Corr_{A,B} = \\frac{Cov_{A,B}}{\\sigma^A \\sigma^B}\\]\nwhere \\(Corr_{A,B}\\) is the correlation coefficient, \\(Cov_{A,B}\\) is the covariance, and \\(\\sigma^A\\) and \\(\\sigma^B\\) are the sample standard deviations of assets A and B. Correlation always falls between -1 and +1, making it much easier to interpret:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Value\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n+1\nPerfect positive correlation: assets move in lockstep\n\n\n0\nNo linear relationship: assets move independently\n\n\n-1\nPerfect negative correlation: assets move in opposite directions\n\n\n\nMost pairs of stocks within the same economy have positive correlations—they tend to rise together in good times and fall together in bad times—but the correlation is usually well below 1, leaving room for diversification benefits.\nExample 3\nSuppose over the past three months META had returns of 10%, 10%, and -8%, and NFLX had returns of 20%, -10%, and -1%.

    "section": "5 Portfolio Total Risk",
    "text": "5 Portfolio Total Risk\nNow we arrive at the central insight of portfolio theory: how risk combines across assets. Unlike expected returns, which combine as a simple weighted average, portfolio risk depends on the correlations between assets in complex and often counterintuitive ways.\nThe variance of a portfolio’s return is given by:\n\\[Var[R_P] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 Var[R_i] + \\sum_{i \\neq j} w_i w_j Cov[R_i, R_j]\\]\nwhere \\(Var[R_P]\\) is the portfolio variance, \\(w_i\\) is the weight of asset \\(i\\), \\(Var[R_i]\\) is the variance of asset \\(i\\)’s returns, and \\(Cov[R_i, R_j]\\) is the covariance between assets \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). The portfolio standard deviation (total risk) is simply the square root of the variance: \\(\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{Var[R_P]}\\).\nThis formula has two distinct components. The first summation captures the individual risk contributions—each asset’s variance, scaled by its squared weight. The second summation captures the interaction effects—how pairs of assets move together, weighted by the product of their weights. The factor of 2 appears because each pair \\((i,j)\\) contributes twice (once for \\(i,j\\) and once for \\(j,i\\)), and the formula accounts for both.\nFor a two-asset portfolio, the formula simplifies to:\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_1^2 Var[R_1] + w_2^2 Var[R_2] + 2w_1 w_2 Cov[R_1, R_2]\\]\nFor a three-asset portfolio:\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_1^2 Var[R_1] + w_2^2 Var[R_2] + w_3^2 Var[R_3] + 2w_1 w_2 Cov[R_1, R_2] + 2w_1 w_3 Cov[R_1, R_3] + 2w_2 w_3 Cov[R_2, R_3]\\]\nThe covariance terms are where the magic of diversification happens. When covariances are less than perfect (which is almost always the case), the portfolio variance will be less than the weighted average of the individual variances. In the extreme case where two assets have a correlation of -1, you can construct a portfolio with zero variance—a risk-free portfolio from risky assets! While such perfect negative correlations are rare in practice, even modest positive correlations below 1 provide meaningful diversification benefits.\nThis is why covariance is so important: it determines how much risk you can eliminate through diversification. The lower the covariances between your assets, the more your portfolio’s risk will fall below what you might naively expect from averaging the individual risks.\nExample 4\nSuppose over the past three months META had returns of 10%, 10%, and -8%, and NFLX had returns of 20%, -10%, and -1%. Today, you invest $1,000 in META and $4,000 in NFLX. What is the total risk of your portfolio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Identify portfolio weights (from Example 2)\n\n\\(w_{META} = 0.20\\) (20%)\n\\(w_{NFLX} = 0.80\\) (80%)\n\nStep 2: Recall or calculate variances (from Example 3)\n\n\\(Var^{META} = 0.0108\\)\n\\(Var^{NFLX} = 0.0237\\)\n\\(Cov_{META,NFLX} = 0.0036\\)\n\nStep 3: Apply the two-asset portfolio variance formula\n\\[Var[R_P] = w_{META}^2 \\times Var^{META} + w_{NFLX}^2 \\times Var^{NFLX} + 2 \\times w_{META} \\times w_{NFLX} \\times Cov_{META,NFLX}\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = (0.20)^2 \\times 0.0108 + (0.80)^2 \\times 0.0237 + 2 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.0036\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.04 \\times 0.0108 + 0.64 \\times 0.0237 + 0.32 \\times 0.0036\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.000432 + 0.015168 + 0.001152\\]\n\\[Var[R_P] = 0.016752\\]\nStep 4: Calculate portfolio standard deviation\n\\[\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{0.016752} = 0.1294 = 12.94\\%\\]\nStep 5: Verify diversification benefit\nLet’s compare to what the risk would be if we simply weighted the standard deviations:\nWeighted average of standard deviations: \\(0.20 \\times 10.39\\% + 0.80 \\times 15.39\\% = 2.08\\% + 12.31\\% = 14.39\\%\\)\nActual portfolio standard deviation: 12.94%\nThe portfolio standard deviation (12.94%) is less than the weighted average of individual standard deviations (14.39%), demonstrating the risk reduction benefit of diversification. This occurs because the correlation between META and NFLX is less than 1 (we calculated it as 0.225 in Example 3)."

    "text": "6 Key Takeaways\nPortfolio analysis builds on a simple foundation—weights determine how much each asset matters—but leads to profound insights about how risk and return combine. The return side is straightforward: a portfolio’s expected return is just a weighted average of its components’ expected returns. You cannot manufacture expected return through portfolio construction; you can only choose where to position yourself between your highest- and lowest-returning assets.\nRisk behaves very differently. While individual asset variances contribute to portfolio variance, so do the covariances between every pair of assets. This creates the possibility of diversification: when assets don’t move in perfect lockstep, combining them produces a portfolio less volatile than you might expect. The mathematics shows this clearly—the covariance terms in the portfolio variance formula can substantially reduce total risk when correlations are low.\nThis distinction between return (which averages simply) and risk (which depends on co-movement) is the central insight of modern portfolio theory. It explains why diversification is often called the only “free lunch” in finance: you can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return, simply by combining assets that don’t move together perfectly.\nRemember too that portfolios are dynamic. Weights change as prices change, meaning that multi-period calculations require updating weights after each period. A portfolio that starts with equal weights will drift toward overweighting winners and underweighting losers unless actively rebalanced."

It accounts for over 90% of the difference in returns between diversified portfolios.

    "section": "2 Holding Period Return (HPR)",
    "text": "2 Holding Period Return (HPR)\nThe holding period return measures the total return on an investment over a specific period of time—the “holding period” during which you own the asset. This is the most fundamental return concept, and all other return measures build upon it.\nThe intuition behind HPR is straightforward: we compare what we end up with to what we started with. For any investment, we calculate the value of all cash flows received by the end of the holding period, then divide by the initial investment. Subtracting one converts this ratio from a gross return to a net return, expressing our gain (or loss) as a percentage of the initial investment.\nFor stocks specifically, the ending value includes both the stock price at the end of the holding period and any dividends received. The HPR from time \\(t_1\\) to time \\(t_2\\) is:\n\\[HPR_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2} = \\frac{P_{t_2} + D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}}{P_{t_1}} - 1\\]\nwhere \\(P_{t_1}\\) is the stock price at the beginning of the holding period, \\(P_{t_2}\\) is the price at the end, and \\(D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}\\) represents dividends received during the holding period.\nThis formula reveals that stock returns come from two distinct sources. By rearranging the equation, we can decompose the HPR into its components:\n\\[HPR_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2} = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_{t_2} - P_{t_1}}{P_{t_1}}}_{\\text{Capital Gain}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}}{P_{t_1}}}_{\\text{Dividend Yield}}\\]\nThe capital gain reflects the change in the stock’s price—appreciation (or depreciation) in the value of the shares themselves. The dividend yield represents income received from the company’s profit distributions. Understanding this decomposition matters because these two components have different risk characteristics and tax treatments. Growth stocks typically generate returns primarily through capital gains, while value stocks and mature companies often provide substantial dividend yields.\nExample 1: Calculating HPR\nSuppose TSLA was trading at $420 per share at the beginning of 2023 and at $500 per share at the end of 2024. During this two-year period, TSLA paid total dividends of $10 per share. Calculate the holding period return, capital gain, and dividend yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the HPR formula:\n\\[HPR = \\frac{P_{t_2} + D}{P_{t_1}} - 1 = \\frac{\\$500 + \\$10}{\\$420} - 1 = \\frac{\\$510}{\\$420} - 1 = 1.2143 - 1 = 0.2143 = 21.43\\%\\]\nBreaking this down into components:\nCapital Gain: \\(\\frac{\\$500 - \\$420}{\\$420} = \\frac{\\$80}{\\$420} = 0.1905 = 19.05\\%\\)\nDividend Yield: \\(\\frac{\\$10}{\\$420} = 0.0238 = 2.38\\%\\)\nWe can verify: \\(19.05\\% + 2.38\\% = 21.43\\%\\) ✓\nOver this two-year period, TSLA generated a total return of 21.43%, with most of it (19.05%) coming from price appreciation and a smaller portion (2.38%) from dividends."

    "section": "3 Total Return Through Compounding",
    "text": "3 Total Return Through Compounding\nWhile HPR tells us the return over a single period, investments typically span multiple periods. The total return through compounding answers the question: if we know the returns for each sub-period, what is the overall return for the entire investment horizon?\nThe key insight is that returns compound multiplicatively, not additively. If your investment gains 10% in one period and loses 10% in the next, you do not break even—you actually lose money. This is because the 10% loss applies to a larger base (your original investment plus the 10% gain), while the 10% gain applied only to your original investment.\nWhen we know the returns for periods 1 through \\(N\\) (denoted \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_N\\)), the total (gross) return over all periods is:\n\\[TR_{1 \\rightarrow N} = (1 + R_1)(1 + R_2) \\cdots (1 + R_N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1 + R_i)\\]\nEach term \\((1 + R_i)\\) represents the gross return for period \\(i\\)—the factor by which wealth multiplies during that period. The product of these factors gives the total wealth multiple over the entire horizon. To express this as a net return (percentage gain or loss), we subtract 1.\nThis multiplicative relationship has important implications. Order does not matter for the final wealth level—gaining 20% then losing 10% produces the same ending wealth as losing 10% then gaining 20%. However, the path matters for other purposes, such as calculating time-weighted returns or understanding intermediate portfolio values.\nExample 2: Computing Total Return\nSuppose over the last three months, TSLA had net returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%. What was the total return on TSLA over this three-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply the gross returns for each period:\n\\[TR = (1 + 0.10)(1 + 0.05)(1 + (-0.03))\\] \\[TR = (1.10)(1.05)(0.97)\\] \\[TR = 1.12035\\]\nThis is the gross total return. To find the net total return:\n\\[\\text{Net Total Return} = 1.12035 - 1 = 0.12035 = 12.035\\%\\]\nNotice that simply adding the returns (\\(10\\% + 5\\% - 3\\% = 12\\%\\)) gives an approximation that is close but not exact. The difference arises from the compounding effect—returns in later periods apply to a larger (or smaller) base than the original investment."

    "text": "4 Geometric Average Return\nWhen comparing investments over multiple periods, we often want to express performance as a single per-period return. The geometric average return (also called the geometric mean return) answers the question: what constant return, earned each period, would produce the same total return as the actual sequence of returns?\nThe geometric average is calculated by taking the \\(N\\)th root of the total gross return and subtracting 1:\n\\[GA = \\left[(1 + R_1)(1 + R_2) \\cdots (1 + R_N)\\right]^{1/N} - 1 = (TR)^{1/N} - 1\\]\nThis can be understood intuitively: if an investment compounds at rate \\(GA\\) for \\(N\\) periods, the total gross return is \\((1 + GA)^N\\). Setting this equal to the actual total return and solving for \\(GA\\) gives our formula.\nThe geometric average differs from the arithmetic average (simple mean) of returns, and this distinction is crucial. The arithmetic average always exceeds the geometric average when returns vary, and the gap widens with greater volatility. Consider an extreme example: an investment that doubles (100% return) then loses half (-50% return) has an arithmetic average of 25% but a geometric average of 0%—accurately reflecting that the investor ended up exactly where they started.\nFor evaluating past performance, the geometric average is the correct measure because it accounts for compounding. The arithmetic average, while useful for estimating expected future returns, overstates historical performance when returns vary.\nExample 3: Calculating Geometric Average\nUsing the same data from Example 2 (monthly returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%), what was the geometric average monthly return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already calculated the total gross return as 1.12035. To find the geometric average:\n\\[GA = (TR)^{1/N} - 1 = (1.12035)^{1/3} - 1\\] \\[GA = 1.0387 - 1 = 0.0387 = 3.87\\%\\]\nWe can verify this: if we compound 3.87% monthly for three months:\n\\((1.0387)^3 = 1.1204 \\approx 1.12035\\) ✓\nFor comparison, the arithmetic average is \\((10\\% + 5\\% - 3\\%)/3 = 4.0\\%\\), which is slightly higher than the geometric average of 3.87%. This difference reflects the volatility drag—the mathematical reality that variable returns produce lower compound growth than constant returns of the same arithmetic average."

    "section": "5 Real Returns and Inflation",
    "text": "5 Real Returns and Inflation\nThe returns we observe in the market are nominal returns—they measure the change in dollar value of our investment. But what we ultimately care about is purchasing power: how many goods and services can our wealth buy? Inflation erodes purchasing power over time, so a nominal return of 10% during a period of 8% inflation leaves us only modestly better off in real terms.\nReal returns adjust for inflation to measure the true increase in purchasing power. The relationship between nominal returns, real returns, and inflation follows from the logic of compounding:\n\\[1 + R_{\\text{nominal}} = (1 + R_{\\text{real}})(1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})\\]\nThis equation states that gross nominal returns equal the product of gross real returns and the gross inflation rate. Solving for the real return:\n\\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nominal}} - \\text{Inflation Rate}}{1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}} = \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}} - 1\\]\nA common approximation subtracts the inflation rate directly from the nominal return (\\(R_{\\text{real}} \\approx R_{\\text{nominal}} - \\text{Inflation Rate}\\)), which works reasonably well when inflation is low. However, the exact formula becomes important during periods of high inflation or when precision matters.\nUnderstanding real returns is essential for long-term financial planning. An investment that earns 6% nominally might seem attractive, but if inflation runs at 5%, the real return is only about 1%—barely keeping pace with rising prices. Conversely, during deflationary periods (negative inflation), even a modest nominal return can represent substantial real gains.\nExample 4: Computing Real Returns\nUsing the same data from Examples 2 and 3, suppose the inflation rate was 0.3% per month over the three-month period. Calculate the real total return on TSLA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need the total inflation over the three-month period. Using the compounding formula:\n\\[\\text{Total Gross Inflation} = (1.003)(1.003)(1.003) = (1.003)^3 = 1.00902\\]\nThis means overall inflation was \\(1.00902 - 1 = 0.902\\%\\) over three months.\nNow we can calculate the real total return. We know the nominal gross total return is 1.12035:\n\\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\text{Inflation}} - 1 = \\frac{1.12035}{1.00902} - 1 = 1.1103 - 1 = 0.1103 = 11.03\\%\\]\nAlternatively, using the formula with net returns: \\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{0.12035 - 0.00902}{1.00902} = \\frac{0.11133}{1.00902} = 0.1103 = 11.03\\%\\]\nThe real return of 11.03% is about 1 percentage point lower than the nominal return of 12.04%, reflecting the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation."

    "section": "6 APR, EAR, and Continuous Compounding",
    "text": "6 APR, EAR, and Continuous Compounding\nSo far, we have discussed how returns compound over multiple discrete periods. But financial institutions quote interest rates in various ways, and understanding how to convert between these conventions is essential for comparing investments or loan terms fairly. Three key concepts govern these conversions: the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the Effective Annual Rate (EAR), and continuous compounding.\nThe Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a standardized way of quoting interest rates that states the simple annual rate without accounting for compounding within the year. If a bank offers a savings account with a 6% APR compounded monthly, this means the account earns \\(6\\%/12 = 0.5\\%\\) each month. The APR is the sum of these periodic rates over a year—essentially the arithmetic rather than geometric annualization of periodic rates. Regulations often require APR disclosure to help consumers compare financial products, but APR alone does not tell you how much you will actually earn or owe.\nThe Effective Annual Rate (EAR), also called the Annual Percentage Yield (APY), measures the actual return over one year after accounting for compounding. Continuing our example, earning 0.5% monthly for 12 months produces a total return of \\((1.005)^{12} - 1 = 6.17\\%\\). This 6.17% EAR represents what you actually earn—it reflects the power of compound interest.\nThe relationship between APR and EAR depends on the compounding frequency \\(m\\) (the number of compounding periods per year):\n\\[EAR = \\left(1 + \\frac{APR}{m}\\right)^m - 1\\]\nConversely, if you know the EAR and want to find the corresponding APR for a given compounding frequency:\n\\[APR = m \\times \\left[(1 + EAR)^{1/m} - 1\\right]\\]\nThe following table illustrates how different compounding frequencies affect the EAR for the same 6% APR:\n\n\n\nCompounding Frequency\nPeriods per Year (\\(m\\))\nPeriodic Rate\nEAR\n\n\n\n\nAnnual\n1\n6.000%\n6.000%\n\n\nSemi-annual\n2\n3.000%\n6.090%\n\n\nQuarterly\n4\n1.500%\n6.136%\n\n\nMonthly\n12\n0.500%\n6.168%\n\n\nDaily\n365\n0.0164%\n6.183%\n\n\nContinuous\n\\(\\infty\\)\n—\n6.184%\n\n\n\nAs compounding becomes more frequent, the EAR increases—but with diminishing increments. The mathematical limit as compounding frequency approaches infinity is continuous compounding.\nContinuous compounding assumes that interest compounds at every instant. While no real-world investment compounds truly continuously, this concept is mathematically elegant and serves as the foundation for many financial models, including option pricing. Under continuous compounding, the EAR for a continuously compounded rate \\(r_c\\) is:\n\\[EAR = e^{r_c} - 1\\]\nAnd the continuously compounded rate corresponding to a given EAR is:\n\\[r_c = \\ln(1 + EAR)\\]\nContinuous compounding has a useful property: continuously compounded returns are additive over time. If the continuously compounded return is 5% in period 1 and 3% in period 2, the total continuously compounded return is simply 8%. This mathematical convenience explains why continuous compounding is prevalent in academic finance and quantitative applications.\nExample 5: Converting Between APR and EAR\nYour bank offers a savings account with a 4.8% APR compounded monthly. A competitor offers 4.85% APR compounded quarterly. Which account offers the better return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare fairly, we convert both to EAR.\nBank 1 (4.8% APR, monthly compounding): \\[EAR_1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.048}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 = (1.004)^{12} - 1 = 1.04907 - 1 = 4.907\\%\\]\nBank 2 (4.85% APR, quarterly compounding): \\[EAR_2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.0485}{4}\\right)^{4} - 1 = (1.012125)^{4} - 1 = 1.04939 - 1 = 4.939\\%\\]\nBank 2 offers a slightly better return (4.939% vs. 4.907%), despite Bank 1 having more frequent compounding. The higher APR at Bank 2 more than compensates for the less frequent compounding.\n\n\n\nExample 6: Continuous Compounding\nAn investment fund reports its continuously compounded annual return as 8%. What is the effective annual rate? If you invest $10,000, how much will you have after 3 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting to EAR: \\[EAR = e^{0.08} - 1 = 1.0833 - 1 = 8.33\\%\\]\nFuture value after 3 years:\nUnder continuous compounding, the future value formula is \\(FV = PV \\times e^{r_c \\times t}\\):\n\\[FV = \\$10{,}000 \\times e^{0.08 \\times 3} = \\$10{,}000 \\times e^{0.24} = \\$10{,}000 \\times 1.2712 = \\$12{,}712\\]\nAlternatively, using the EAR: \\[FV = \\$10{,}000 \\times (1.0833)^3 = \\$10{,}000 \\times 1.2712 = \\$12{,}712\\]\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming that the continuously compounded rate and EAR are simply different ways of expressing the same growth rate."

    "section": "7 Key Takeaways",
    "text": "7 Key Takeaways\nThe concepts we have developed in this lecture form a coherent framework for measuring and comparing investment performance. At the foundation is the holding period return, which captures the total gain or loss over any specific time horizon by comparing ending wealth (including any cash flows received) to the initial investment. For stocks, this naturally decomposes into capital gains from price appreciation and dividend yield from income distributions.\nWhen returns span multiple periods, we must account for compounding—the fact that gains and losses in later periods apply to the accumulated wealth, not just the original investment. The total return multiplies the gross returns of each sub-period, reflecting this compounding behavior. To express multi-period performance as a single per-period figure, we use the geometric average, which finds the constant return that would replicate the actual compounded outcome. The geometric average always falls below the arithmetic average when returns vary, with the gap widening as volatility increases.\nBecause inflation erodes purchasing power, distinguishing nominal from real returns is essential for meaningful performance evaluation. Real returns adjust for inflation using the exact relationship between gross nominal returns, gross real returns, and the gross inflation rate. This adjustment is particularly important for long-term planning, where even modest inflation differences compound dramatically over decades.\nFinally, when comparing financial products or working with interest rates, we must navigate different quoting conventions. The APR states a simple annual rate without reflecting within-year compounding, while the EAR captures the true annual growth rate. Converting between these using the appropriate compounding frequency allows fair comparisons. The limiting case of continuous compounding, while theoretical, provides mathematical elegance and underpins much of quantitative finance.\nTogether, these tools enable us to answer the fundamental questions of investment analysis: How much did we make? How does that compare to alternatives? And how much of our gain represents true increases in purchasing power?"

    "text": "9 Practice Problems\nPractice Problem 1: Holding Period Return\nMicrosoft (MSFT) was trading at $280 per share at the start of 2022 and at $375 at the end of 2023. During this two-year period, Microsoft paid total dividends of $5.00 per share. Calculate the holding period return, capital gain, and dividend yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nHPR: \\[HPR = \\frac{\\$375 + \\$5.00}{\\$280} - 1 = \\frac{\\$380}{\\$280} - 1 = 1.3571 - 1 = 35.71\\%\\]\nCapital Gain: \\[\\frac{\\$375 - \\$280}{\\$280} = \\frac{\\$95}{\\$280} = 33.93\\%\\]\nDividend Yield: \\[\\frac{\\$5.00}{\\$280} = 1.79\\%\\]\nVerification: \\(33.93\\% + 1.79\\% = 35.72\\%\\) ✓ (small rounding difference)\nMicrosoft delivered a 35.71% return over two years, with the vast majority (33.93%) from capital appreciation and a small contribution (1.79%) from dividends.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 2: Total Return Through Compounding\nAn S&P 500 index fund had the following quarterly returns: Q1: +8%, Q2: -2%, Q3: +4%, Q4: +6%. What was the total return for the year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[TR = (1.08)(0.98)(1.04)(1.06)\\] \\[TR = (1.0584)(1.04)(1.06)\\] \\[TR = (1.1007)(1.06)\\] \\[TR = 1.1668\\]\nNet Total Return: \\(1.1668 - 1 = 16.68\\%\\)\nThe fund gained 16.68% for the year. Note that simply adding the returns (\\(8\\% - 2\\% + 4\\% + 6\\% = 16\\%\\)) slightly underestimates the actual return because it ignores compounding.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 3: Geometric Average\nUsing the quarterly returns from Practice Problem 2, calculate the geometric average quarterly return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already found \\(TR = 1.1668\\). The geometric average over 4 quarters is:\n\\[GA = (1.1668)^{1/4} - 1 = 1.0393 - 1 = 3.93\\%\\]\nIf the fund earned exactly 3.93% each quarter, it would produce the same annual return: \\((1.0393)^4 = 1.1668\\) ✓\nThe arithmetic average is \\((8\\% - 2\\% + 4\\% + 6\\%)/4 = 4.0\\%\\), which slightly overstates average performance compared to the geometric average of 3.93%.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 4: Real Returns\nA bond fund earned a nominal return of 5.5% last year. If inflation for the year was 3.2%, what was the real return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the exact formula:\n\\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\text{Inflation}} - 1 = \\frac{1.055}{1.032} - 1 = 1.0223 - 1 = 2.23\\%\\]\nThe approximation (\\(5.5\\% - 3.2\\% = 2.3\\%\\)) is close but slightly overstates the real return.\nIn real terms, purchasing power increased by only 2.23%, meaning inflation consumed more than half of the nominal return.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 5: APR and EAR Conversions\nA credit card charges 18% APR compounded daily (assume 365 days). What is the effective annual rate? How much interest would accrue on a $5,000 balance if unpaid for one year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nEAR: \\[EAR = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.18}{365}\\right)^{365} - 1 = (1.000493)^{365} - 1 = 1.1972 - 1 = 19.72\\%\\]\nInterest on $5,000: \\[\\text{Interest} = \\$5{,}000 \\times 0.1972 = \\$986\\]\nThe 18% APR translates to a 19.72% effective rate due to daily compounding. On a $5,000 balance, this means $986 in interest over one year—nearly $100 more than the $900 you might expect from the stated 18% APR.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 6: Continuous Compounding\nA Treasury bond has a yield of 4.5% expressed as a continuously compounded rate. What is the EAR? If you invest $25,000 in this bond, what will it be worth in 5 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nEAR: \\[EAR = e^{0.045} - 1 = 1.04603 - 1 = 4.603\\%\\]\nFuture Value: \\[FV = \\$25{,}000 \\times e^{0.045 \\times 5} = \\$25{,}000 \\times e^{0.225} = \\$25{,}000 \\times 1.2523 = \\$31{,}308\\]\nThe $25,000 investment grows to $31,308 over five years, a gain of $6,308 or 25.23%."

    "section": "3 Holding period return (HPR)",
    "text": "3 Holding period return (HPR)\nThe holding period return (HPR) answers the most basic performance question an investor can ask:\n\n“If I buy the asset at the beginning of the period and sell it at the end, how much did I make (or lose), including any cash paid out along the way?”\n\nThat “including cash paid out” clause is crucial. For stocks, cash payouts come mainly from dividends (and occasionally other distributions). If you ignore dividends, you can understate a stock’s total payoff—especially for mature dividend-paying firms. HPR gives us a clean way to measure performance over one holding period, and it also provides the building block we will compound when we study multi-period performance.\n\n3.1 Formula (stocks)\nLet:\n\n(P_{T_1}) = stock price at the start of the holding period (time (T_1))\n\n(P_{T_2}) = stock price at the end of the holding period (time (T_2))\n\n(D_{T_2}) = total dividends paid during the holding period (often treated as paid by (T_2) for “end-of-period” accounting)\n\nThen the net holding period return from (T_1) to (T_2) is:\n[ HPR_{T_1 T_2} = - 1 ]\nIt is often useful to rewrite HPR as a sum of two parts:\n[ HPR_{T_1 T_2} = {} ;+; {} ]\nThis decomposition matters because it tells you where the return came from. Some stocks deliver most of their return through price appreciation (growth stocks), while others deliver more through dividend income (income stocks). Later, when we discuss portfolio objectives, taxes, and factor exposures, it will be helpful to distinguish “price return” from “cash yield.”\n\n\n3.2 Example 1: HPR and its components\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nSuppose you buy a share of TSLA for (P_{0}=$420). Two years later you sell it for (P_{2}=$520). Over the two-year holding period you received dividends totaling (D=$10) per share.\n\nWhat is the holding period return (HPR) over the two years?\n\nWhat portion of the return came from capital gains vs. dividend yield?\n\n\n\nStep 1: Compute net HPR.\n[ HPR = - 1 = - 1 = - 1 ]\nCompute the ratio:\n[ = 1.2619048 ]\nSo:\n[ HPR - 1 = 0.2619 ;=; 26.19% ]\nStep 2: Decompose into capital gains and dividend yield.\nCapital gains (price return):\n[ = = = 23.81% ]\nDividend yield over the holding period:\n[ = = 2.381% ]\nCheck that they add up:\n[ 23.81% + 2.381% % ]\nSo, most of the two-year return came from price appreciation, with a smaller contribution from dividends."

    "section": "4 Total return (compounding)",
    "text": "4 Total return (compounding)\nHPR is a single-period return. But investors and researchers often need to summarize performance over many periods—months, quarters, or years—especially when we have return data as a time series.\nThe key idea is that wealth grows through compounding. If you earn 10% and then -5%, the -5% applies to the new wealth level after the first period’s gain. That is why multi-period performance is built by multiplying gross returns.\nThis also explains a common intuition trap: a +50% return followed by a -50% return does not bring you back to break-even. Starting from $100, +50% takes you to $150; then -50% takes you to $75. Compounding makes losses “hurt” more than equal-sized gains help.\n\n4.1 Formula\nLet (R_{1}, R_{2}, , R_{N}) be the net returns earned in each of (N) consecutive subperiods. (For example, these could be monthly returns for (N) months.)\nDefine each gross return as (1+R_i).\nThen the gross total return over the full horizon is:\n[ 1 + TR = _{i=1}^{N}(1+R_i) ]\nand the net total return is:\n[ TR = _{i=1}^{N}(1+R_i) - 1 ]\nTotal return is the right measure when the question is “How much did $1 invested at the start grow to by the end?” It is also what you need for wealth-index charts, for verifying portfolio accounting, and for linking performance across different horizons.\n\n\n4.2 Example 2: Total return from a sequence of monthly returns\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nSuppose TSLA had the following monthly net returns over the last three months:\n\nMonth 1: (R_1 = 10%)\n\nMonth 2: (R_2 = -5%)\n\nMonth 3: (R_3 = 12%)\n\nWhat was the net total return over the three-month period?\n\n\nConvert each monthly net return to a gross return and multiply:\n[ 1 + TR = (1+R_1)(1+R_2)(1+R_3) = (1.10)(0.95)(1.12) ]\nMultiply step-by-step:\n\n(1.10 = 1.045)\n\n(1.045 = 1.1704)\n\nSo the gross total return is (1.1704), which means the net total return is:\n[ TR = 1.1704 - 1 = 0.1704 = 17.04% ]\nInterpretation: $1 invested at the start of Month 1 becomes $1.1704 after Month 3."

    "text": "5 Geometric average\nNow suppose you know the returns in each subperiod (like monthly returns), and you compute the total return over the entire horizon. A natural next question is:\n\n“What constant per-period return would produce the same total growth over the whole horizon?”\n\nThat constant per-period return is the geometric average return. It is sometimes called the compound average growth rate (CAGR) when the period is a year.\nThe geometric average matters because it respects compounding. It is therefore the right “average return” when you want to describe a multi-period track record on a per-period basis, compare different investments over different horizons, or translate an overall growth experience into an equivalent steady rate. It is also the average you would use if you were telling a story like: “Over this span, the investment grew as if it earned about (x%) per month.”\n\n5.1 Formula\nUsing the same notation as above, if there are (N) subperiods, the geometric average net return is:\n[ GA = ^{1/N} - 1 ]\nSince the term inside the brackets is the gross total return, you will often see:\n[ GA = (1+TR)^{1/N} - 1 ]\nA quick conceptual note: the arithmetic average of returns (simple mean) is useful for some statistical tasks (like estimating a one-period expected return under certain assumptions). But when the goal is “average growth,” the geometric average is the one aligned with how wealth compounds.\n\n\n5.2 Example 3: Geometric average corresponding to a three-month track record\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nUsing the same three monthly returns from Example 2 (10%, -5%, 12%), what is the geometric average monthly return over the three-month period?\n\n\nFrom Example 2 we already computed the gross total return:\n[ 1+TR = 1.1704 ]\nWith (N=3) months, the geometric average monthly return is:\n[ GA = (1+TR)^{1/3} - 1 = (1.1704)^{1/3} - 1 ]\nCompute the cube root (you can do this with a calculator):\n[ (1.1704)^{1/3} ]\nSo:\n[ GA - 1 = 0.0539 = 5.39% ]\nInterpretation: earning about 5.39% each month for three months would generate the same overall three-month growth as the actual volatile sequence of 10%, -5%, and 12%."

    "text": "6 Real returns (inflation)\nSo far, every return we computed was a nominal return—it measures how many dollars you end up with relative to how many dollars you started with. But investors ultimately care about what money can buy. If prices in the economy are rising, then some of your nominal gain may simply be compensation for inflation.\nThat is why we compute real returns, which adjust nominal returns for inflation and measure the growth of purchasing power. This is especially important when:\n\nComparing performance across decades (inflation regimes can differ a lot),\nEvaluating long-horizon goals (retirement, endowments),\nInterpreting “high” returns during high-inflation periods.\n\n\n6.1 Relationship between nominal and real returns\nLet:\n\n(R_{}) = nominal net return over the period\n\n(R_{}) = real net return over the period\n\n() = inflation rate over the same period\n\nThe compounding relationship is:\n[ 1 + R_{} = (1 + R_{})(1 + ) ]\nSolving for the real net return gives:\n[ R_{} = - 1 = ]\n(Those two expressions are algebraically equivalent; the first is usually easiest to remember.)\nIf you are working with CPI data, a common way to compute period inflation is:\n[ _t = - 1 ]\nwhere (CPI_t) is the CPI level in period (t).\n\n\n6.2 Example 4: Real total return over three months\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nUsing the same three-month performance from Example 2 (net total return (TR = 17.04%)), suppose inflation over the three months was (= 2.0%) in total. What is the real total return over the three months?\n\n\nUse the real-return adjustment:\n[ R_{} = - 1 ]\nHere, (R_{} = TR = 0.1704) and (= 0.02).

You want each month to have the TSLA return and CPI level (or monthly inflation).\n\nCompute the performance measures. Use the formulas from earlier sections to compute:\n\nTotal return over the full horizon (compound monthly returns),\nGeometric average monthly return over the horizon,\nTotal real return over the horizon (adjust the total nominal return for the horizon’s inflation).\n\n\nTwo practical tips that save headaches:\n\nCheck missing returns. If a return is missing, you need a consistent rule (drop the month, fill carefully, or verify the identifier). Missing values can silently break compounding.\n\nKeep frequencies consistent. If your returns are monthly, compute inflation monthly (or compute horizon inflation from the CPI endpoints for the horizon). Don’t mix monthly returns with annual inflation without converting one of them.\n\n\n\n7.3 What to submit / practice\nUsing your downloaded data:\n\nCalculate the total return on TSLA for the entire five-year period.\n\nCalculate the geometric average return on TSLA over the entire period.\n\nCalculate the total real return on TSLA for the entire five-year period.\n\n(These are direct applications of the formulas above; the main work is careful data handling.)"

We started with the holding period return because it captures the full payoff from owning a stock over a single interval, including both price changes and dividends. Once we move beyond one period, the logic of compounding takes over: total return across many periods is the product of gross returns, which tells us exactly how an initial investment would have grown. To communicate that multi-period growth as a per-period rate, we use the geometric average—the constant return that would have generated the same ending wealth. Finally, because investors care about purchasing power, we convert nominal returns into real returns by adjusting for inflation. Together, these concepts form a toolkit you will use repeatedly: to summarize a stock’s past performance, to compare investments on a consistent basis, and to prepare return data for deeper analysis of risk and expected return."

    "section": "2 Holding Period Return (HPR)",
    "text": "2 Holding Period Return (HPR)\nThe holding period return measures the total return on an investment over a specific period of time—the “holding period” during which you own the asset. This is the most fundamental return concept, and all other return measures build upon it.\nThe intuition behind HPR is straightforward: we compare what we end up with to what we started with. For any investment, we calculate the value of all cash flows received by the end of the holding period, then divide by the initial investment. Subtracting one converts this ratio from a gross return to a net return, expressing our gain (or loss) as a percentage of the initial investment.\nFor stocks specifically, the ending value includes both the stock price at the end of the holding period and any dividends received. The HPR from time \\(t_1\\) to time \\(t_2\\) is:\n\\[HPR_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2} = \\frac{P_{t_2} + D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}}{P_{t_1}} - 1\\]\nwhere \\(P_{t_1}\\) is the stock price at the beginning of the holding period, \\(P_{t_2}\\) is the price at the end, and \\(D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}\\) represents dividends received during the holding period.\nThis formula reveals that stock returns come from two distinct sources. By rearranging the equation, we can decompose the HPR into its components:\n\\[HPR_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2} = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_{t_2} - P_{t_1}}{P_{t_1}}}_{\\text{Capital Gain}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{D_{t_1 \\rightarrow t_2}}{P_{t_1}}}_{\\text{Dividend Yield}}\\]\nThe capital gain reflects the change in the stock’s price—appreciation (or depreciation) in the value of the shares themselves. The dividend yield represents income received from the company’s profit distributions. Understanding this decomposition matters because these two components have different risk characteristics and tax treatments. Growth stocks typically generate returns primarily through capital gains, while value stocks and mature companies often provide substantial dividend yields.\nExample 1: Calculating HPR\nSuppose TSLA was trading at $420 per share at the beginning of 2023 and at $500 per share at the end of 2024. During this two-year period, TSLA paid total dividends of $10 per share. Calculate the holding period return, capital gain, and dividend yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the HPR formula:\n\\[HPR = \\frac{P_{t_2} + D}{P_{t_1}} - 1 = \\frac{\\$500 + \\$10}{\\$420} - 1 = \\frac{\\$510}{\\$420} - 1 = 1.2143 - 1 = 0.2143 = 21.43\\%\\]\nBreaking this down into components:\nCapital Gain: \\(\\frac{\\$500 - \\$420}{\\$420} = \\frac{\\$80}{\\$420} = 0.1905 = 19.05\\%\\)\nDividend Yield: \\(\\frac{\\$10}{\\$420} = 0.0238 = 2.38\\%\\)\nWe can verify: \\(19.05\\% + 2.38\\% = 21.43\\%\\) ✓\nOver this two-year period, TSLA generated a total return of 21.43%, with most of it (19.05%) coming from price appreciation and a smaller portion (2.38%) from dividends."

    "section": "3 Total Return Through Compounding",
    "text": "3 Total Return Through Compounding\nWhile HPR tells us the return over a single period, investments typically span multiple periods. The total return through compounding answers the question: if we know the returns for each sub-period, what is the overall return for the entire investment horizon?\nThe key insight is that returns compound multiplicatively, not additively. If your investment gains 10% in one period and loses 10% in the next, you do not break even—you actually lose money. This is because the 10% loss applies to a larger base (your original investment plus the 10% gain), while the 10% gain applied only to your original investment.\nWhen we know the returns for periods 1 through \\(N\\) (denoted \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_N\\)), the total (gross) return over all periods is:\n\\[TR_{1 \\rightarrow N} = (1 + R_1)(1 + R_2) \\cdots (1 + R_N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1 + R_i)\\]\nEach term \\((1 + R_i)\\) represents the gross return for period \\(i\\)—the factor by which wealth multiplies during that period. The product of these factors gives the total wealth multiple over the entire horizon. To express this as a net return (percentage gain or loss), we subtract 1.\nThis multiplicative relationship has important implications. Order does not matter for the final wealth level—gaining 20% then losing 10% produces the same ending wealth as losing 10% then gaining 20%. However, the path matters for other purposes, such as calculating time-weighted returns or understanding intermediate portfolio values.\nExample 2: Computing Total Return\nSuppose over the last three months, TSLA had net returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%. What was the total return on TSLA over this three-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe multiply the gross returns for each period:\n\\[TR = (1 + 0.10)(1 + 0.05)(1 + (-0.03))\\] \\[TR = (1.10)(1.05)(0.97)\\] \\[TR = 1.12035\\]\nThis is the gross total return. To find the net total return:\n\\[\\text{Net Total Return} = 1.12035 - 1 = 0.12035 = 12.035\\%\\]\nNotice that simply adding the returns (\\(10\\% + 5\\% - 3\\% = 12\\%\\)) gives an approximation that is close but not exact. The difference arises from the compounding effect—returns in later periods apply to a larger (or smaller) base than the original investment."

    "section": "4 Geometric Average Return",
    "text": "4 Geometric Average Return\nWhen comparing investments over multiple periods, we often want to express performance as a single per-period return. The geometric average return (also called the geometric mean return) answers the question: what constant return, earned each period, would produce the same total return as the actual sequence of returns?\nThe geometric average is calculated by taking the \\(N\\)th root of the total gross return and subtracting 1:\n\\[GA = \\left[(1 + R_1)(1 + R_2) \\cdots (1 + R_N)\\right]^{1/N} - 1 = (TR)^{1/N} - 1\\]\nThis can be understood intuitively: if an investment compounds at rate \\(GA\\) for \\(N\\) periods, the total gross return is \\((1 + GA)^N\\). Setting this equal to the actual total return and solving for \\(GA\\) gives our formula.\nThe geometric average differs from the arithmetic average (simple mean) of returns, and this distinction is crucial. The arithmetic average always exceeds the geometric average when returns vary, and the gap widens with greater volatility. Consider an extreme example: an investment that doubles (100% return) then loses half (-50% return) has an arithmetic average of 25% but a geometric average of 0%—accurately reflecting that the investor ended up exactly where they started.\nFor evaluating past performance, the geometric average is the correct measure because it accounts for compounding. The arithmetic average, while useful for estimating expected future returns, overstates historical performance when returns vary.\nExample 3: Calculating Geometric Average\nUsing the same data from Example 2 (monthly returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%), what was the geometric average monthly return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already calculated the total gross return as 1.12035. To find the geometric average:\n\\[GA = (TR)^{1/N} - 1 = (1.12035)^{1/3} - 1\\] \\[GA = 1.0387 - 1 = 0.0387 = 3.87\\%\\]\nWe can verify this: if we compound 3.87% monthly for three months:\n\\((1.0387)^3 = 1.1204 \\approx 1.12035\\) ✓\nFor comparison, the arithmetic average is \\((10\\% + 5\\% - 3\\%)/3 = 4.0\\%\\), which is slightly higher than the geometric average of 3.87%. This difference reflects the volatility drag—the mathematical reality that variable returns produce lower compound growth than constant returns of the same arithmetic average."

    "section": "5 Real Returns and Inflation",
    "text": "5 Real Returns and Inflation\nThe returns we observe in the market are nominal returns—they measure the change in dollar value of our investment. But what we ultimately care about is purchasing power: how many goods and services can our wealth buy? Inflation erodes purchasing power over time, so a nominal return of 10% during a period of 8% inflation leaves us only modestly better off in real terms.\nReal returns adjust for inflation to measure the true increase in purchasing power. The relationship between nominal returns, real returns, and inflation follows from the logic of compounding:\n\\[1 + R_{\\text{nominal}} = (1 + R_{\\text{real}})(1 + \\text{Inflation Rate})\\]\nThis equation states that gross nominal returns equal the product of gross real returns and the gross inflation rate. Solving for the real return:\n\\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{nominal}} - \\text{Inflation Rate}}{1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}} = \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}} - 1\\]\nA common approximation subtracts the inflation rate directly from the nominal return (\\(R_{\\text{real}} \\approx R_{\\text{nominal}} - \\text{Inflation Rate}\\)), which works reasonably well when inflation is low. However, the exact formula becomes important during periods of high inflation or when precision matters.\nUnderstanding real returns is essential for long-term financial planning. An investment that earns 6% nominally might seem attractive, but if inflation runs at 5%, the real return is only about 1%—barely keeping pace with rising prices. Conversely, during deflationary periods (negative inflation), even a modest nominal return can represent substantial real gains.\nExample 4: Computing Real Returns\nUsing the same data from Examples 2 and 3, suppose the inflation rate was 0.3% per month over the three-month period. Calculate the real total return on TSLA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need the total inflation over the three-month period. Using the compounding formula:\n\\[\\text{Total Gross Inflation} = (1.003)(1.003)(1.003) = (1.003)^3 = 1.00902\\]\nThis means overall inflation was \\(1.00902 - 1 = 0.902\\%\\) over three months.\nNow we can calculate the real total return. We know the nominal gross total return is 1.12035:\n\\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\text{Inflation}} - 1 = \\frac{1.12035}{1.00902} - 1 = 1.1103 - 1 = 0.1103 = 11.03\\%\\]\nAlternatively, using the formula with net returns: \\[R_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{0.12035 - 0.00902}{1.00902} = \\frac{0.11133}{1.00902} = 0.1103 = 11.03\\%\\]\nThe real return of 11.03% is about 1 percentage point lower than the nominal return of 12.04%, reflecting the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation."

    "section": "6 APR, EAR, and Continuous Compounding",
    "text": "6 APR, EAR, and Continuous Compounding\nSo far, we have discussed how returns compound over multiple discrete periods. But financial institutions quote interest rates in various ways, and understanding how to convert between these conventions is essential for comparing investments or loan terms fairly. Three key concepts govern these conversions: the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the Effective Annual Rate (EAR), and continuous compounding.\nThe Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a standardized way of quoting interest rates that states the simple annual rate without accounting for compounding within the year. If a bank offers a savings account with a 6% APR compounded monthly, this means the account earns \\(6\\%/12 = 0.5\\%\\) each month. The APR is the sum of these periodic rates over a year—essentially the arithmetic rather than geometric annualization of periodic rates. Regulations often require APR disclosure to help consumers compare financial products, but APR alone does not tell you how much you will actually earn or owe.\nThe Effective Annual Rate (EAR), also called the Annual Percentage Yield (APY), measures the actual return over one year after accounting for compounding. Continuing our example, earning 0.5% monthly for 12 months produces a total return of \\((1.005)^{12} - 1 = 6.17\\%\\). This 6.17% EAR represents what you actually earn—it reflects the power of compound interest.\nThe relationship between APR and EAR depends on the compounding frequency \\(m\\) (the number of compounding periods per year):\n\\[EAR = \\left(1 + \\frac{APR}{m}\\right)^m - 1\\]\nConversely, if you know the EAR and want to find the corresponding APR for a given compounding frequency:\n\\[APR = m \\times \\left[(1 + EAR)^{1/m} - 1\\right]\\]\nThe following table illustrates how different compounding frequencies affect the EAR for the same 6% APR:\n\n\n\nCompounding Frequency\nPeriods per Year (\\(m\\))\nPeriodic Rate\nEAR\n\n\n\n\nAnnual\n1\n6.000%\n6.000%\n\n\nSemi-annual\n2\n3.000%\n6.090%\n\n\nQuarterly\n4\n1.500%\n6.136%\n\n\nMonthly\n12\n0.500%\n6.168%\n\n\nDaily\n365\n0.0164%\n6.183%\n\n\nContinuous\n\\(\\infty\\)\n—\n6.184%\n\n\n\nAs compounding becomes more frequent, the EAR increases—but with diminishing increments. The mathematical limit as compounding frequency approaches infinity is continuous compounding.\nContinuous compounding assumes that interest compounds at every instant. While no real-world investment compounds truly continuously, this concept is mathematically elegant and serves as the foundation for many financial models, including option pricing. Under continuous compounding, the EAR for a continuously compounded rate \\(r_c\\) is:\n\\[EAR = e^{r_c} - 1\\]\nAnd the continuously compounded rate corresponding to a given EAR is:\n\\[r_c = \\ln(1 + EAR)\\]\nContinuous compounding has a useful property: continuously compounded returns are additive over time. If the continuously compounded return is 5% in period 1 and 3% in period 2, the total continuously compounded return is simply 8%. This mathematical convenience explains why continuous compounding is prevalent in academic finance and quantitative applications.\nExample 5: Converting Between APR and EAR\nYour bank offers a savings account with a 4.8% APR compounded monthly. A competitor offers 4.85% APR compounded quarterly. Which account offers the better return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compare fairly, we convert both to EAR.\nBank 1 (4.8% APR, monthly compounding): \\[EAR_1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.048}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 = (1.004)^{12} - 1 = 1.04907 - 1 = 4.907\\%\\]\nBank 2 (4.85% APR, quarterly compounding): \\[EAR_2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.0485}{4}\\right)^{4} - 1 = (1.012125)^{4} - 1 = 1.04939 - 1 = 4.939\\%\\]\nBank 2 offers a slightly better return (4.939% vs. 4.907%), despite Bank 1 having more frequent compounding. The higher APR at Bank 2 more than compensates for the less frequent compounding.\n\n\n\nExample 6: Continuous Compounding\nAn investment fund reports its continuously compounded annual return as 8%. What is the effective annual rate? If you invest $10,000, how much will you have after 3 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting to EAR: \\[EAR = e^{0.08} - 1 = 1.0833 - 1 = 8.33\\%\\]\nFuture value after 3 years:\nUnder continuous compounding, the future value formula is \\(FV = PV \\times e^{r_c \\times t}\\):\n\\[FV = \\$10{,}000 \\times e^{0.08 \\times 3} = \\$10{,}000 \\times e^{0.24} = \\$10{,}000 \\times 1.2712 = \\$12{,}712\\]\nAlternatively, using the EAR: \\[FV = \\$10{,}000 \\times (1.0833)^3 = \\$10{,}000 \\times 1.2712 = \\$12{,}712\\]\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming that the continuously compounded rate and EAR are simply different ways of expressing the same growth rate."

    "section": "7 Key Takeaways",
    "text": "7 Key Takeaways\nThe concepts we have developed in this lecture form a coherent framework for measuring and comparing investment performance. At the foundation is the holding period return, which captures the total gain or loss over any specific time horizon by comparing ending wealth (including any cash flows received) to the initial investment. For stocks, this naturally decomposes into capital gains from price appreciation and dividend yield from income distributions.\nWhen returns span multiple periods, we must account for compounding—the fact that gains and losses in later periods apply to the accumulated wealth, not just the original investment. The total return multiplies the gross returns of each sub-period, reflecting this compounding behavior. To express multi-period performance as a single per-period figure, we use the geometric average, which finds the constant return that would replicate the actual compounded outcome. The geometric average always falls below the arithmetic average when returns vary, with the gap widening as volatility increases.\nBecause inflation erodes purchasing power, distinguishing nominal from real returns is essential for meaningful performance evaluation. Real returns adjust for inflation using the exact relationship between gross nominal returns, gross real returns, and the gross inflation rate. This adjustment is particularly important for long-term planning, where even modest inflation differences compound dramatically over decades.\nFinally, when comparing financial products or working with interest rates, we must navigate different quoting conventions. The APR states a simple annual rate without reflecting within-year compounding, while the EAR captures the true annual growth rate. Converting between these using the appropriate compounding frequency allows fair comparisons. The limiting case of continuous compounding, while theoretical, provides mathematical elegance and underpins much of quantitative finance.\nTogether, these tools enable us to answer the fundamental questions of investment analysis: How much did we make? How does that compare to alternatives? And how much of our gain represents true increases in purchasing power?"

How much interest would accrue on a $5,000 balance if unpaid for one year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nEAR: \\[EAR = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.18}{365}\\right)^{365} - 1 = (1.000493)^{365} - 1 = 1.1972 - 1 = 19.72\\%\\]\nInterest on $5,000: \\[\\text{Interest} = \\$5{,}000 \\times 0.1972 = \\$986\\]\nThe 18% APR translates to a 19.72% effective rate due to daily compounding. On a $5,000 balance, this means $986 in interest over one year—nearly $100 more than the $900 you might expect from the stated 18% APR.\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 6: Continuous Compounding\nA Treasury bond has a yield of 4.5% expressed as a continuously compounded rate. What is the EAR? If you invest $25,000 in this bond, what will it be worth in 5 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nEAR: \\[EAR = e^{0.045} - 1 = 1.04603 - 1 = 4.603\\%\\]\nFuture Value: \\[FV = \\$25{,}000 \\times e^{0.045 \\times 5} = \\$25{,}000 \\times e^{0.225} = \\$25{,}000 \\times 1.2523 = \\$31{,}308\\]\nThe $25,000 investment grows to $31,308 over five years, a gain of $6,308 or 25.23%."

    "section": "3 Holding period return (HPR)",
    "text": "3 Holding period return (HPR)\nThe holding period return (HPR) answers the most basic performance question an investor can ask:\n\n“If I buy the asset at the beginning of the period and sell it at the end, how much did I make (or lose), including any cash paid out along the way?”\n\nThat “including cash paid out” clause is crucial. For stocks, cash payouts come mainly from dividends (and occasionally other distributions). If you ignore dividends, you can understate a stock’s total payoff—especially for mature dividend-paying firms. HPR gives us a clean way to measure performance over one holding period, and it also provides the building block we will compound when we study multi-period performance.\n\n3.1 Formula (stocks)\nLet:\n\n\\(P_{T_1}\\) = stock price at the start of the holding period (time \\(T_1\\))\n\n\\(P_{T_2}\\) = stock price at the end of the holding period (time \\(T_2\\))\n\n\\(D_{T_2}\\) = total dividends paid during the holding period (often treated as paid by \\(T_2\\) for “end-of-period” accounting)\n\nThen the net holding period return from \\(T_1\\) to \\(T_2\\) is:\n\\[\nHPR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2} = \\frac{P_{T_2} + D_{T_2}}{P_{T_1}} - 1\n\\]\nIt is often useful to rewrite HPR as a sum of two parts:\n\\[\nHPR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2} = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_{T_2}-P_{T_1}}{P_{T_1}}}_{\\text{capital gains (price return)}} \\;+\\; \\underbrace{\\frac{D_{T_2}}{P_{T_1}}}_{\\text{dividend yield}}\n\\]\nThis decomposition matters because it tells you where the return came from. Some stocks deliver most of their return through price appreciation (growth stocks), while others deliver more through dividend income (income stocks). Later, when we discuss portfolio objectives, taxes, and factor exposures, it will be helpful to distinguish “price return” from “cash yield.”\n\n\n3.2 Example 1: HPR and its components\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nSuppose you buy a share of TSLA for \\(P_{0}=\\$420\\). Two years later you sell it for \\(P_{2}=\\$520\\). Over the two-year holding period you received dividends totaling \\(D=\\$10\\) per share.\n\nWhat is the holding period return (HPR) over the two years?\n\nWhat portion of the return came from capital gains vs. dividend yield?\n\n\n\nStep 1: Compute net HPR.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nHPR &= \\frac{P_2 + D}{P_0} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{520 + 10}{420} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{530}{420} - 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCompute the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{530}{420} = 1.2619048\\ldots\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nHPR \\approx 1.2619 - 1 = 0.2619 \\;=\\; 26.19\\%\n\\]\nStep 2: Decompose into capital gains and dividend yield.\nCapital gains (price return):\n\\[\n\\frac{P_2 - P_0}{P_0} = \\frac{520 - 420}{420} = \\frac{100}{420} \\approx 0.2381 = 23.81\\%\n\\]\nDividend yield over the holding period:\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{P_0} = \\frac{10}{420} \\approx 0.02381 = 2.381\\%\n\\]\nCheck that they add up:\n\\[\n23.81\\% + 2.381\\% \\approx 26.19\\%\n\\]\nSo, most of the two-year return came from price appreciation, with a smaller contribution from dividends."

    "section": "4 Total return (compounding)",
    "text": "4 Total return (compounding)\nHPR is a single-period return. But investors and researchers often need to summarize performance over many periods—months, quarters, or years—especially when we have return data as a time series.\nThe key idea is that wealth grows through compounding. If you earn 10% and then -5%, the -5% applies to the new wealth level after the first period’s gain. That is why multi-period performance is built by multiplying gross returns.\nThis also explains a common intuition trap: a +50% return followed by a -50% return does not bring you back to break-even. Starting from $100, +50% takes you to $150; then -50% takes you to $75. Compounding makes losses “hurt” more than equal-sized gains help.\n\n4.1 Formula\nLet \\(R_{1}, R_{2}, \\dots, R_{N}\\) be the net returns earned in each of \\(N\\) consecutive subperiods. (For example, these could be monthly returns for \\(N\\) months.)\nDefine each gross return as \\(1+R_i\\).\nThen the gross total return over the full horizon is:\n\\[\n1 + TR = \\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1+R_i)\n\\]\nand the net total return is:\n\\[\nTR = \\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1+R_i) - 1\n\\]\nTotal return is the right measure when the question is “How much did $1 invested at the start grow to by the end?” It is also what you need for wealth-index charts, for verifying portfolio accounting, and for linking performance across different horizons.\n\n\n4.2 Example 2: Total return from a sequence of monthly returns\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nSuppose TSLA had the following monthly net returns over the last three months:\n\nMonth 1: \\(R_1 = 10\\%\\)\n\nMonth 2: \\(R_2 = -5\\%\\)\n\nMonth 3: \\(R_3 = 12\\%\\)\n\nWhat was the net total return over the three-month period?\n\n\nConvert each monthly net return to a gross return and multiply:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 + TR &= (1+R_1)(1+R_2)(1+R_3) \\\\\n&= (1.10)(0.95)(1.12)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMultiply step-by-step:\n\n\\(1.10 \\times 0.95 = 1.045\\)\n\n\\(1.045 \\times 1.12 = 1.1704\\)\n\nSo the gross total return is \\(1.1704\\), which means the net total return is:\n\\[\nTR = 1.1704 - 1 = 0.1704 = 17.04\\%\n\\]\nInterpretation: $1 invested at the start of Month 1 becomes $1.1704 after Month 3."

    "text": "5 Geometric average\nNow suppose you know the returns in each subperiod (like monthly returns), and you compute the total return over the entire horizon. A natural next question is:\n\n“What constant per-period return would produce the same total growth over the whole horizon?”\n\nThat constant per-period return is the geometric average return. It is sometimes called the compound average growth rate (CAGR) when the period is a year.\nThe geometric average matters because it respects compounding. It is therefore the right “average return” when you want to describe a multi-period track record on a per-period basis, compare different investments over different horizons, or translate an overall growth experience into an equivalent steady rate. It is also the average you would use if you were telling a story like: “Over this span, the investment grew as if it earned about \\(x\\%\\) per month.”\n\n5.1 Formula\nUsing the same notation as above, if there are \\(N\\) subperiods, the geometric average net return is:\n\\[\nGA = \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{N}(1+R_i)\\right]^{1/N} - 1\n\\]\nSince the term inside the brackets is the gross total return, you will often see:\n\\[\nGA = (1+TR)^{1/N} - 1\n\\]\nA quick conceptual note: the arithmetic average of returns (simple mean) is useful for some statistical tasks (like estimating a one-period expected return under certain assumptions). But when the goal is “average growth,” the geometric average is the one aligned with how wealth compounds.\n\n\n5.2 Example 3: Geometric average corresponding to a three-month track record\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nUsing the same three monthly returns from Example 2 (10%, -5%, 12%), what is the geometric average monthly return over the three-month period?\n\n\nFrom Example 2 we already computed the gross total return:\n\\[\n1+TR = 1.1704\n\\]\nWith \\(N=3\\) months, the geometric average monthly return is:\n\\[\nGA = (1+TR)^{1/3} - 1 = (1.1704)^{1/3} - 1\n\\]\nCompute the cube root (you can do this with a calculator):\n\\[\n(1.1704)^{1/3} \\approx 1.0539\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nGA \\approx 1.0539 - 1 = 0.0539 = 5.39\\% \\text{ per month}\n\\]\nInterpretation: earning about 5.39% each month for three months would generate the same overall three-month growth as the actual volatile sequence of 10%, -5%, and 12%."

    "text": "6 Real returns (inflation)\nSo far, every return we computed was a nominal return—it measures how many dollars you end up with relative to how many dollars you started with. But investors ultimately care about what money can buy. If prices in the economy are rising, then some of your nominal gain may simply be compensation for inflation.\nThat is why we compute real returns, which adjust nominal returns for inflation and measure the growth of purchasing power. This is especially important when:\n\nComparing performance across decades (inflation regimes can differ a lot),\nEvaluating long-horizon goals (retirement, endowments),\nInterpreting “high” returns during high-inflation periods.\n\n\n6.1 Relationship between nominal and real returns\nLet:\n\n\\(R_{\\text{nominal}}\\) = nominal net return over the period\n\n\\(R_{\\text{real}}\\) = real net return over the period\n\n\\(\\pi\\) = inflation rate over the same period\n\nThe compounding relationship is:\n\\[\n1 + R_{\\text{nominal}} = (1 + R_{\\text{real}})(1 + \\pi)\n\\]\nSolving for the real net return gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{\\text{real}} &= \\frac{1 + R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1 + \\pi} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{R_{\\text{nominal}} - \\pi}{1+\\pi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n(Those two expressions are algebraically equivalent; the first is usually easiest to remember.)\nIf you are working with CPI data, a common way to compute period inflation is:\n\\[\n\\pi_t = \\frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-1}} - 1\n\\]\nwhere \\(CPI_t\\) is the CPI level in period \\(t\\).\n\n\n6.2 Example 4: Real total return over three months\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nUsing the same three-month performance from Example 2 (net total return \\(TR = 17.04\\%\\)), suppose inflation over the three months was \\(\\pi = 2.0\\%\\) in total.

    "text": "7 Key Takeaways\nPast returns are not just “history”—they are the raw material for measurement and comparison in finance. We started with the holding period return because it captures the full payoff from owning a stock over a single interval, including both price changes and dividends. Once we move beyond one period, the logic of compounding takes over: total return across many periods is the product of gross returns, which tells us exactly how an initial investment would have grown. To communicate that multi-period growth as a per-period rate, we use the geometric average—the constant return that would have generated the same ending wealth. Finally, because investors care about purchasing power, we convert nominal returns into real returns by adjusting for inflation. Together, these concepts form a toolkit you will use repeatedly: to summarize a stock’s past performance, to compare investments on a consistent basis, and to prepare return data for deeper analysis of risk and expected return."

During the year, the stock paid total dividends of \\(D_1=\\$2\\) per share.\n\nWhat is the one-year holding period return (HPR)?\n\nBreak the HPR into the price return and dividend yield components.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Compute HPR.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nHPR &= \\frac{P_1 + D_1}{P_0}-1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{47 + 2}{50} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\frac{49}{50} - 1 \\\\\n&= 0.98 - 1 \\\\\n&= -0.02\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSo the one-year HPR is:\n\\[\nHPR = -0.02 = -2\\%\n\\]\nStep 2: Decompose into price return and dividend yield.\nPrice return:\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0} = \\frac{47 - 50}{50} = \\frac{-3}{50} = -0.06 = -6\\%\n\\]\nDividend yield:\n\\[\n\\frac{D_1}{P_0} = \\frac{2}{50} = 0.04 = 4\\%\n\\]\nCheck:\n\\[\n-6\\% + 4\\% = -2\\%\n\\]\nInterpretation: The investor lost money overall because the price drop outweighed the dividend income.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 Practice Problem 2: Total return from quarterly returns\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nAn asset has the following quarterly net returns over one year:\n\nQ1: \\(R_1 = 6\\%\\)\n\nQ2: \\(R_2 = -3\\%\\)\n\nQ3: \\(R_3 = 8\\%\\)\n\nQ4: \\(R_4 = 2\\%\\)\n\nWhat is the net total return over the full year?\n\n\nTotal return over multiple periods comes from multiplying gross returns:\n\\[\n1+TR = (1+R_1)(1+R_2)(1+R_3)(1+R_4)\n\\]\nPlug in:\n\\[\n1+TR = (1.06)(0.97)(1.08)(1.02)\n\\]\nMultiply step-by-step:\n\n\\(1.06 \\times 0.97 = 1.0282\\)\n\n\\(1.0282 \\times 1.08 = 1.110456\\)\n\n\\(1.110456 \\times 1.02 = 1.13266512\\)\n\nSo:\n\\[\nTR = 1.13266512 - 1 = 0.13266512 \\approx 13.27\\%\n\\]\nInterpretation: $1 invested at the start of Q1 becomes about $1.1327 by the end of Q4.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3 Practice Problem 3: Geometric average annual return\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nA stock has the following annual net returns:\n\nYear 1: \\(R_1 = 8\\%\\)\n\nYear 2: \\(R_2 = -12\\%\\)\n\nYear 3: \\(R_3 = 15\\%\\)\n\n\nWhat is the three-year total return?\n\nWhat is the geometric average annual return over the three years?\n\n\n\nPart 1: Total return.\nConvert to gross returns and multiply:\n\\[\n1+TR = (1.08)(0.88)(1.15)\n\\]\nMultiply:\n\n\\(1.08 \\times 0.88 = 0.9504\\)\n\n\\(0.9504 \\times 1.15 = 1.09396\\)\n\nSo the three-year total return is:\n\\[\nTR = 1.09396 - 1 = 0.09396 \\approx 9.40\\%\n\\]\nPart 2: Geometric average annual return.\nWith \\(N=3\\) years:\n\\[\nGA = (1+TR)^{1/3} - 1 = (1.09396)^{1/3} - 1\n\\]\nCompute the cube root:\n\\[\n(1.09396)^{1/3} \\approx 1.0304\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nGA \\approx 1.0304 - 1 = 0.0304 = 3.04\\% \\text{ per year}\n\\]\nInterpretation: Even though the annual returns swing (8%, -12%, 15%), the investment grew overall as if it earned about 3.04% per year for three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4 Practice Problem 4: Real return using CPI\n\nExampleSolution\n\n\nYou invest in an index fund and earn a nominal one-year return of \\(R_{\\text{nominal}} = 7\\%\\). Over the same year, CPI rises from \\(CPI_0 = 300\\) to \\(CPI_1 = 312\\).\n\nWhat is the inflation rate \\(\\pi\\) over the year?\n\nWhat is the real one-year return?\n\n\n\nPart 1: Compute inflation from CPI.\n\\[\n\\pi = \\frac{CPI_1}{CPI_0} - 1 = \\frac{312}{300} - 1 = 1.04 - 1 = 0.04 = 4\\%\n\\]\nPart 2: Compute the real return.\nUse the real-return adjustment:\n\\[\nR_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1+R_{\\text{nominal}}}{1+\\pi} - 1\n\\]\nPlug in \\(R_{\\text{nominal}}=0.07\\) and \\(\\pi=0.04\\):\n\\[\nR_{\\text{real}} = \\frac{1.07}{1.04} - 1\n\\]\nCompute the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{1.07}{1.04} \\approx 1.028846\\ldots\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\nR_{\\text{real}} \\approx 1.028846 - 1 = 0.028846 \\approx 2.88\\%\n\\]\nInterpretation: You earned 7% in dollars, but only about 2.88% in purchasing power because prices rose by about 4%."

    "section": "2 Holding Period Return",
    "text": "2 Holding Period Return\n\n2.1 The Basic Concept\nThe holding period return (HPR) answers the most fundamental question in investing: if I buy an asset and hold it for some period of time, what is my total return? The “holding period” is simply the time between when you purchase the asset and when you sell it (or when you’re measuring performance).\nThe intuition is straightforward. When you invest in a stock, you can make money in two ways. First, the stock price might increase—this is called a capital gain. Second, the company might pay you dividends while you own the stock—this is your dividend income. Your total return combines both of these sources of wealth.\nTo calculate the HPR, we need to compare what we end up with to what we started with. Specifically, we take the total value of everything we receive (the ending stock price plus any dividends) and divide by what we paid (the beginning stock price). This gives us the gross return—the ratio of ending wealth to beginning wealth. We then subtract 1 to convert this to a net return, which tells us the percentage gain or loss.\n\n\n2.2 The Formula\nFor a stock held from time \\(T_1\\) to time \\(T_2\\), the holding period return is:\n\\[HPR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2} = \\frac{P_{T_2} + D_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2}}{P_{T_1}} - 1\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(P_{T_1}\\) = stock price at the beginning of the holding period\n\\(P_{T_2}\\) = stock price at the end of the holding period\n\n\\(D_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2}\\) = total dividends received during the holding period\n\nThis formula can be rewritten to show the two components of return separately:\n\\[HPR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2} = \\underbrace{\\frac{P_{T_2} - P_{T_1}}{P_{T_1}}}_{\\text{Capital Gains Yield}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{D_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_2}}{P_{T_1}}}_{\\text{Dividend Yield}}\\]\nThis decomposition is useful because different types of stocks generate returns in different ways. Growth stocks like Tesla or Amazon historically paid little or no dividends, so their returns came almost entirely from capital gains. In contrast, mature companies like AT&T or utility stocks often have modest price appreciation but pay substantial dividends. Understanding where returns come from helps you evaluate whether a stock fits your investment strategy.\n\n\n2.3 Example 1: Calculating Holding Period Return\nSuppose you purchased shares of Tesla (TSLA) at the beginning of 2022 for $350 per share. At the end of 2023, the stock was trading at $490 per share. During this two-year period, Tesla paid total dividends of $0 per share (Tesla does not currently pay dividends). Calculate the holding period return, capital gains yield, and dividend yield for this investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 1\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Identify the values\n\nBeginning price (\\(P_{T_1}\\)): $350\nEnding price (\\(P_{T_2}\\)): $490\nDividends (\\(D\\)): $0\n\nStep 2: Calculate the holding period return\n\\[HPR = \\frac{P_{T_2} + D}{P_{T_1}} - 1 = \\frac{\\$490 + \\$0}{\\$350} - 1 = \\frac{\\$490}{\\$350} - 1 = 1.40 - 1 = 0.40 = 40\\%\\]\nStep 3: Calculate the components\nCapital Gains Yield: \\[\\frac{P_{T_2} - P_{T_1}}{P_{T_1}} = \\frac{\\$490 - \\$350}{\\$350} = \\frac{\\$140}{\\$350} = 0.40 = 40\\%\\]\nDividend Yield: \\[\\frac{D}{P_{T_1}} = \\frac{\\$0}{\\$350} = 0\\%\\]\nInterpretation: Over this two-year period, an investment in Tesla would have returned 40%, all of which came from capital appreciation. Since Tesla doesn’t pay dividends, the dividend yield is zero. Note that this is the total return over two years—not an annualized figure."

    "section": "3 Total Return (Compounding)",
    "text": "3 Total Return (Compounding)\n\n3.1 Why Compounding Matters\nThe holding period return works well when we know the beginning and ending values of an investment. But what if we know the returns for individual sub-periods and want to find the overall return? For instance, you might know that a stock returned 10% in Year 1, 5% in Year 2, and -3% in Year 3. What was the total return over all three years?\nYour first instinct might be to simply add the returns: 10% + 5% + (-3%) = 12%. But this would be incorrect, and understanding why reveals something fundamental about how wealth grows over time.\nThe reason addition doesn’t work is that returns compound—each period’s return is earned on a base that includes the previous periods’ gains (or losses). If you start with $100 and earn 10% in Year 1, you end Year 1 with $110. In Year 2, you earn 5%—but you earn it on $110, not on your original $100. So your Year 2 gain is $5.50, not $5.00. This compounding effect means returns must be multiplied, not added.\n\n\n3.2 The Formula\nTo find the total return over multiple periods, we multiply the gross returns (1 + net return) for each period:\n\\[TR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N} = (1 + R_{T_1})(1 + R_{T_2}) \\cdots (1 + R_{T_N})\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(TR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N}\\) = total gross return from period \\(T_1\\) through period \\(T_N\\)\n\\(R_{T_i}\\) = net return in period \\(i\\)\n\\((1 + R_{T_i})\\) = gross return in period \\(i\\)\n\nThe result is a gross return. To convert to a net return (percentage gain), subtract 1:\n\\[\\text{Net Total Return} = TR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N} - 1\\]\nThe intuition behind multiplying gross returns is that each gross return represents a “growth factor.” If your investment grows by 10%, your wealth is multiplied by 1.10. If it then grows by 5%, your new wealth is multiplied by 1.05. The overall growth factor is therefore \\(1.10 \\times 1.05 = 1.155\\), meaning your wealth has grown by 15.5%, not 15%.\n\n\n3.3 Example 2: Calculating Total Return with Compounding\nSuppose that over the past three months, Tesla had net returns of 10%, 5%, and -3% in months 1, 2, and 3 respectively. What was the total return on Tesla over this three-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Convert net returns to gross returns\n\nMonth 1: \\(1 + 0.10 = 1.10\\)\nMonth 2: \\(1 + 0.05 = 1.05\\)\n\nMonth 3: \\(1 + (-0.03) = 0.97\\)\n\nStep 2: Multiply the gross returns\n\\[TR = 1.10 \\times 1.05 \\times 0.97 = 1.12035\\]\nStep 3: Convert to net return\n\\[\\text{Net Total Return} = 1.12035 - 1 = 0.12035 = 12.035\\%\\]\nInterpretation: Over the three-month period, Tesla returned approximately 12.04% in total. Notice this is slightly higher than the simple sum of returns (10% + 5% - 3% = 12%) because of the compounding effect—the 5% gain in Month 2 was earned on a larger base that included the 10% gain from Month 1.\nVerification with dollars: If you invested $1,000:\n\nAfter Month 1: \\(\\$1,000 \\times 1.10 = \\$1,100\\)\nAfter Month 2: \\(\\$1,100 \\times 1.05 = \\$1,155\\)\nAfter Month 3: \\(\\$1,155 \\times 0.97 = \\$1,120.35\\)\n\nTotal gain: \\(\\$1,120.35 - \\$1,000 = \\$120.35\\), which is \\(12.035\\%\\) of $1,000."

    "section": "4 Geometric Average Return",
    "text": "4 Geometric Average Return\n\n4.1 The Problem with Arithmetic Averages\nNow suppose you want to describe the “average” return over multiple periods. Using our example above, you might be tempted to calculate the arithmetic average: \\((10\\% + 5\\% + (-3\\%))/3 = 4\\%\\). But this arithmetic average can be misleading, especially when returns are volatile.\nConsider an extreme example: a stock returns +100% in Year 1 and -50% in Year 2. The arithmetic average is \\((100\\% + (-50\\%))/2 = 25\\%\\). Sounds great! But let’s trace what happens to $100 invested in this stock. After Year 1, you have $200. After Year 2, you have $100. You ended up exactly where you started—your true average annual return was 0%, not 25%.\nThe geometric average solves this problem by finding the constant return that, if earned each period, would produce the same total return as the actual sequence of varying returns. It directly incorporates the compounding effect and gives you a meaningful measure of average periodic performance.\n\n\n4.2 The Formula\nThe geometric average return over \\(N\\) periods is:\n\\[GA_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N} = \\left[(1 + R_{T_1})(1 + R_{T_2}) \\cdots (1 + R_{T_N})\\right]^{1/N} - 1\\]\nThis can be written more compactly using the total return:\n\\[GA_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N} = \\left[TR_{T_1 \\rightarrow T_N}\\right]^{1/N} - 1\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(GA\\) = geometric average (net) return per period\n\\(TR\\) = total gross return over all periods\n\\(N\\) = number of periods\n\nThe geometric average has an elegant interpretation: if you earned exactly this return every single period, you would end up with the same final wealth as you did with the actual varying returns. This makes it the correct measure for comparing average performance across investments or time periods.\n\n\n4.3 Example 3: Calculating the Geometric Average Return\nUsing the same data as in Example 2 (monthly returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%), what was the geometric average monthly return of Tesla over the three-month period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 3\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total gross return (from Example 2)\n\\[TR = 1.10 \\times 1.05 \\times 0.97 = 1.12035\\]\nStep 2: Take the Nth root (where N = 3 months)\n\\[GA = (1.12035)^{1/3} - 1\\]\n\\[(1.12035)^{1/3} = 1.03867\\]\n\\[GA = 1.03867 - 1 = 0.03867 = 3.867\\%\\]\nInterpretation: The geometric average monthly return was approximately 3.87%. This means that if Tesla had returned exactly 3.87% every single month for three months, the total return would be the same 12.035% we calculated earlier.\nVerification:\n\\[1.03867 \\times 1.03867 \\times 1.03867 = 1.03867^3 = 1.12035\\]\nThis confirms our answer: earning 3.867% each month for 3 months gives the same result as earning 10%, 5%, and -3% in successive months.\nComparison with arithmetic average: The arithmetic average is \\((10\\% + 5\\% + (-3\\%))/3 = 4\\%\\). The geometric average (3.867%) is slightly lower. This is always the case when returns vary—the geometric average is always less than or equal to the arithmetic average, with equality only when all returns are identical."

    "section": "5 Real Returns",
    "text": "5 Real Returns\n\n5.1 Why Inflation Matters\nAll the returns we’ve discussed so far are nominal returns—they measure changes in dollar values without accounting for changes in what those dollars can buy. But as investors, we ultimately care about purchasing power. If your investment returns 5% but prices rise by 5%, you haven’t actually gotten any richer in terms of what you can buy.\nThis distinction becomes critical when comparing returns across different time periods or countries with different inflation rates. A 10% return in 1980 (when U.S. inflation was around 13%) was actually a loss in purchasing power, while a 10% return in 2020 (when inflation was about 1.5%) represented a substantial real gain.\nReal returns strip out the inflation component to show what you actually earned in terms of purchasing power. This is the return that matters for your actual standard of living.\n\n\n5.2 The Formula\nThe relationship between nominal returns, real returns, and inflation is:\n\\[(1 + R_{nominal}) = (1 + R_{real})(1 + \\pi)\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi\\) represents the inflation rate. Solving for the real return:\n\\[R_{real} = \\frac{1 + R_{nominal}}{1 + \\pi} - 1 = \\frac{R_{nominal} - \\pi}{1 + \\pi}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(R_{real}\\) = real (inflation-adjusted) net return\n\\(R_{nominal}\\) = nominal (observed) net return\n\\(\\pi\\) = inflation rate over the same period\n\nYou might sometimes see a simpler approximation: \\(R_{real} \\approx R_{nominal} - \\pi\\). This approximation works reasonably well when both the nominal return and inflation rate are small (say, under 10%), but the exact formula should be used for precision or when dealing with higher rates.\n\n\n5.3 Compounding Real Returns\nJust like nominal returns, real returns compound over multiple periods. To find the total real return over several periods, you can either convert each period’s nominal return to a real return and then compound, or compound the nominal returns and the inflation rates separately and then adjust.\n\n\n5.4 Example 4: Calculating Real Total Return\nUsing the same data as in Example 2 (monthly nominal returns of 10%, 5%, and -3%), and assuming the inflation rate was 0.5% in each of the three months, calculate the real total return on Tesla over the three-month period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 4\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1: Convert each period to real returns, then compound\nStep 1: Calculate real return for each month\nMonth 1: \\[R_{real,1} = \\frac{0.10 - 0.005}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.095}{1.005} = 0.09453 = 9.453\\%\\]\nMonth 2: \\[R_{real,2} = \\frac{0.05 - 0.005}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.045}{1.005} = 0.04478 = 4.478\\%\\]\nMonth 3: \\[R_{real,3} = \\frac{-0.03 - 0.005}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{-0.035}{1.005} = -0.03483 = -3.483\\%\\]\nStep 2: Compound the real returns\n\\[TR_{real} = (1.09453)(1.04478)(0.96517) = 1.10396\\]\n\\[\\text{Net Real Total Return} = 1.10396 - 1 = 0.10396 = 10.40\\%\\]\nMethod 2: Adjust total nominal return by total inflation\nStep 1: Calculate total nominal return (from Example 2)\n\\[TR_{nominal} = 1.12035\\]\nStep 2: Calculate total inflation factor\n\\[\\text{Total Inflation} = (1.005)(1.005)(1.005) = 1.005^3 = 1.01508\\]\nStep 3: Calculate real total return\n\\[TR_{real} = \\frac{TR_{nominal}}{\\text{Total Inflation}} = \\frac{1.12035}{1.01508} = 1.10369\\]\n\\[\\text{Net Real Total Return} = 1.10369 - 1 = 0.10369 = 10.37\\%\\]\n(The small difference between methods is due to rounding in intermediate calculations.)\nInterpretation: While the nominal total return was 12.04%, the real total return was only about 10.4%. The difference of roughly 1.6 percentage points represents the purchasing power lost to inflation over the three months. In other words, although your dollar wealth increased by 12.04%, prices also rose by about 1.5%, so your actual increase in purchasing power was 10.4%."

    "text": "6 Key Takeaways\nUnderstanding how to measure returns is foundational to becoming a thoughtful investor. The holding period return gives us the basic building block—it tells us the total percentage gain or loss over any single period, combining both capital gains and dividend income into one comprehensive measure. Whenever you’re evaluating what happened to an investment between two points in time, the HPR is your starting point.\nWhen we have returns over multiple periods, we cannot simply add them together. Returns compound, meaning each period’s return applies to a growing (or shrinking) base that includes all previous gains and losses. The total return formula captures this compounding effect by multiplying gross returns rather than adding net returns. This is why a 50% loss is so devastating—it takes a 100% gain just to get back to even, not a 50% gain.\nThe geometric average return extends this compounding logic to give us a meaningful “average” return per period. Unlike the arithmetic average, which can paint a misleadingly rosy picture when returns are volatile, the geometric average tells us the constant rate of return that would replicate our actual wealth growth. This is the number you should use when someone asks “what was the average annual return?” and you want to give an accurate answer.\nFinally, real returns remind us that what ultimately matters is purchasing power, not just dollar amounts. By stripping out inflation, we can see what our investments actually earned in terms of goods and services we can buy. This adjustment is essential for comparing returns across different time periods with different inflation environments, and for understanding whether your investments are actually making you wealthier in any meaningful sense.\nThese four concepts form a coherent system: HPR measures single-period performance, compounding links periods together, the geometric average summarizes multi-period performance on a per-period basis, and the real return adjustment ensures we’re measuring what actually matters. With these tools, you can critically evaluate any return statistic you encounter and avoid being misled by numbers that seem impressive but may not tell the full story."

    "section": "8 Practice Problems",
    "text": "8 Practice Problems\n\n8.1 Practice Problem 1: Holding Period Return\nYou purchased 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) on January 1, 2023 at $130 per share. On December 31, 2024, the shares were trading at $185 per share. During this two-year period, Apple paid total dividends of $1.90 per share. Calculate the holding period return, decomposing it into capital gains yield and dividend yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 1\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\nBeginning price (\\(P_{T_1}\\)): $130\nEnding price (\\(P_{T_2}\\)): $185\nTotal dividends (\\(D\\)): $1.90\n\nCalculate the holding period return:\n\\[HPR = \\frac{P_{T_2} + D}{P_{T_1}} - 1 = \\frac{\\$185 + \\$1.90}{\\$130} - 1 = \\frac{\\$186.90}{\\$130} - 1 = 1.4377 - 1 = 43.77\\%\\]\nCalculate capital gains yield:\n\\[CGY = \\frac{P_{T_2} - P_{T_1}}{P_{T_1}} = \\frac{\\$185 - \\$130}{\\$130} = \\frac{\\$55}{\\$130} = 42.31\\%\\]\nCalculate dividend yield:\n\\[DY = \\frac{D}{P_{T_1}} = \\frac{\\$1.90}{\\$130} = 1.46\\%\\]\nVerify: \\(42.31\\% + 1.46\\% = 43.77\\%\\) ✓\nInterpretation: Over the two-year period, Apple delivered a total return of 43.77%. The vast majority (42.31%) came from price appreciation, with a small contribution (1.46%) from dividends. This is typical of a growth-oriented company that prioritizes reinvesting profits over paying dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Practice Problem 2: Total Return with Compounding\nAn S&P 500 index fund had the following annual returns over a four-year period: Year 1: +28%, Year 2: +18%, Year 3: -4%, Year 4: +12%. What was the total return over the entire four-year period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 2\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Convert each annual return to a gross return\n\nYear 1: \\(1 + 0.28 = 1.28\\)\nYear 2: \\(1 + 0.18 = 1.18\\)\nYear 3: \\(1 + (-0.04) = 0.96\\)\nYear 4: \\(1 + 0.12 = 1.12\\)\n\nStep 2: Multiply all gross returns\n\\[TR = 1.28 \\times 1.18 \\times 0.96 \\times 1.12 = 1.6239\\]\nStep 3: Convert to net total return\n\\[\\text{Net Total Return} = 1.6239 - 1 = 0.6239 = 62.39\\%\\]\nInterpretation: Over the four-year period, the fund returned 62.39% in total. If you had invested $10,000 at the start, you would have $16,239 at the end. Note that the simple sum of returns would be \\(28\\% + 18\\% - 4\\% + 12\\% = 54\\%\\), which understates the actual total return because it ignores the compounding effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Practice Problem 3: Geometric Average\nUsing the data from Practice Problem 2, calculate the geometric average annual return for the S&P 500 index fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 3\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Use the total return calculated in Practice Problem 2\n\\[TR = 1.6239\\]\nStep 2: Calculate the geometric average\n\\[GA = (TR)^{1/N} - 1 = (1.6239)^{1/4} - 1\\]\n\\[(1.6239)^{0.25} = 1.1290\\]\n\\[GA = 1.1290 - 1 = 0.1290 = 12.90\\%\\]\nComparison with arithmetic average:\n\\[\\text{Arithmetic Average} = \\frac{28\\% + 18\\% + (-4\\%) + 12\\%}{4} = \\frac{54\\%}{4} = 13.50\\%\\]\nInterpretation: The geometric average annual return was 12.90%, meaning if the fund had returned exactly 12.90% every year for four years, the ending wealth would be identical to what actually occurred. The arithmetic average (13.50%) is higher, which is always the case when returns vary. The 0.60 percentage point difference reflects the “volatility drag” caused by the sequence of varying returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Practice Problem 4: Real Returns\nAn international stock fund returned 8% in nominal terms over the past year. During the same period, inflation in the investor’s home country was 3.2%. What was the real return on this investment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 4\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\nNominal return (\\(R_{nominal}\\)): 8% = 0.08\nInflation rate (\\(\\pi\\)): 3.2% = 0.032\n\nCalculate the real return:\n\\[R_{real} = \\frac{R_{nominal} - \\pi}{1 + \\pi} = \\frac{0.08 - 0.032}{1 + 0.032} = \\frac{0.048}{1.032} = 0.04651 = 4.65\\%\\]\nUsing the approximation for comparison:\n\\[R_{real} \\approx R_{nominal} - \\pi = 8\\% - 3.2\\% = 4.8\\%\\]\nInterpretation: While the investment grew by 8% in dollar terms, inflation eroded 3.2% of purchasing power. The true increase in what you can actually buy is 4.65%. The simple approximation (4.8%) overstates the real return slightly because it ignores the compounding interaction between returns and inflation. For typical return and inflation levels, this difference is small, but it becomes more significant with higher inflation rates."

    "text": "9 Ask an LLM\nHere are three questions you might ask an AI assistant to deepen your understanding of these concepts:\n\n“Can you explain why the geometric average return is always less than or equal to the arithmetic average return? Walk me through a mathematical proof or intuitive explanation, and help me understand when the gap between them is largest.”\nThis question will help you understand the mathematical relationship between these two averages and why volatility creates a “drag” on compound returns—a concept that has important implications for portfolio construction and risk management.\n“Imagine I’m comparing two investments: Investment A returned +50% in Year 1 and -30% in Year 2. Investment B returned +10% in both years. Both have the same arithmetic average return of 10% per year. Can you show me which investment actually left the investor wealthier and explain why this happens?”\nThis question uses a concrete example to illustrate why the geometric average is the correct measure of investment performance, and why high volatility can hurt long-term wealth accumulation even when average returns look the same.\n“In periods of very high inflation, like the 1970s in the United States or recent periods in countries like Argentina or Turkey, how do real and nominal returns differ dramatically? Can you give me some historical examples that illustrate why distinguishing between real and nominal returns is so important?”\nThis question will provide real-world context for why real returns matter, and help you appreciate scenarios where investors earned positive nominal returns but actually lost purchasing power—or conversely, where modest nominal returns represented excellent real performance."

    "section": "2 Securities Markets",
    "text": "2 Securities Markets\n\n2.1 Primary and Secondary Markets\nSecurities markets divide into primary and secondary markets, each serving a distinct function. The primary market is where new securities are born. When a company conducts an initial public offering (IPO) or issues new bonds, it’s raising fresh capital in the primary market. Investment banks typically underwrite these offerings, guaranteeing a price to the issuer and bearing the risk of selling the securities to investors. A prospectus must be filed with the SEC disclosing all material information about the issuer and the offering.\nThe secondary market is where existing securities trade among investors. When you buy shares of Apple on the stock exchange, Apple doesn’t receive any money—you’re buying from another investor who previously owned those shares. The secondary market serves the crucial function of providing liquidity: knowing you can sell a security easily makes you more willing to buy it in the first place. Secondary markets also provide continuous price discovery, generating the information that makes primary markets function.\n\n\n2.2 Market Structures\nSecurities trade through several different market structures. Traditional exchanges like the NYSE provide a centralized, regulated venue where buyers and sellers meet. Over-the-counter (OTC) dealer markets, common for bonds, rely on dealers who stand ready to buy or sell from their own inventory, quoting bid prices (at which they’ll buy) and ask prices (at which they’ll sell). Electronic communication networks (ECNs) and modern electronic exchanges use automated systems to match orders, largely replacing the human intermediaries of earlier eras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nMechanism\nExample\n\n\n\n\nExchange\nCentralized, regulated\nNYSE\n\n\nOTC (Dealer)\nDealers quote bid/ask\nBond markets\n\n\nElectronic Communication Networks (ECNs)\nAutomated order matching\nMany modern exchanges\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Order Types\nInvestors express their trading intentions through different order types:\n\nA market order instructs the broker to execute immediately at the best available price. You get certainty of execution but uncertainty about price.\nA limit order specifies a maximum buying price or minimum selling price. You get price certainty but risk the order not executing at all.\nA stop order remains dormant until a trigger price is reached, then becomes a market order. Stop orders are often used to limit losses or protect profits.\n\n\n\n2.4 Buying on Margin\nMargin trading allows investors to borrow from their brokers to purchase securities, amplifying both potential gains and potential losses. When you buy on margin, you put up a fraction of the purchase price (the initial margin, typically 50%) and borrow the rest from your broker.\nBrokers protect themselves by requiring you to maintain a minimum equity percentage (the maintenance margin, typically 25-30%). If your equity falls below this level due to price declines, you’ll receive a margin call demanding that you deposit additional funds or sell securities to restore your margin. The price at which a margin call occurs can be calculated as:\n\\[P_{\\text{call}} = P_0 \\times \\frac{1 - \\text{initial margin}}{1 - \\text{maintenance margin}}\\]\nLeverage is a double-edged sword. If you buy $10,000 of stock with $5,000 of your own money and the stock rises 20%, your return on equity is 40% (minus interest costs). But if the stock falls 20%, you’ve lost 40% of your equity. Margin amplifies outcomes in both directions.\n\n\n2.5 Short Selling\nShort selling allows investors to profit from falling prices by reversing the usual sequence of transactions. Instead of buying low and selling high, short sellers sell high first (borrowing shares to deliver to the buyer) and hope to buy low later (returning shares to the lender). The mechanics work as follows: you borrow shares from your broker’s inventory, sell them in the market, and later buy shares to return to the lender. If the price has fallen, you profit; if it has risen, you lose.\nShort selling carries unique risks. Unlike a long position, where your maximum loss is your initial investment, short positions have theoretically unlimited loss potential—there’s no ceiling on how high a stock price can rise. Short sellers must also pay any dividends to the share lender and post margin against their positions. Despite these challenges, short selling plays an important role in markets by allowing negative information to be reflected in prices.\n\n\n2.6 Market Regulation\nSecurities markets operate under extensive regulation designed to promote fairness, transparency, and investor protection. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary federal regulator, overseeing securities laws and market participants. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a self-regulatory organization that oversees broker-dealers.\nKey regulatory principles include mandatory disclosure (companies must reveal material information), prohibition of insider trading (those with material nonpublic information cannot trade on it), and Regulation FD (fair disclosure), which requires companies to release material information to all investors simultaneously rather than selectively. These rules aim to create a level playing field where investors can trust that prices reflect publicly available information."

    "section": "3 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies",
    "text": "3 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies\n\n3.1 The Value Proposition\nInvestment companies exist because they solve real problems for individual investors. Diversification is perhaps the most important: by pooling money from many investors, a mutual fund can hold hundreds of securities, reducing the risk that any single company’s troubles will devastate the portfolio. Individual investors would find it prohibitively expensive to achieve this diversification on their own. Professional management provides expertise that most individuals lack. Record-keeping and administration handle the paperwork of tracking dividends, capital gains, and tax obligations. For open-end funds, immediate liquidity means investors can convert their holdings to cash on any business day.\n\n\n3.2 Types of Investment Companies\nInvestment companies come in several varieties, each with distinct characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nShares\nPricing\nKey Feature\n\n\n\n\nOpen-end (mutual funds)\nRedeemable\nNAV (end of day)\nMost common\n\n\nClosed-end funds\nFixed, trade on exchange\nMarket price (premium/discount to NAV)\nCan trade intraday\n\n\nETFs\nTrade on exchange\nNear NAV via arbitrage\nTax-efficient, low cost\n\n\nUnit Investment Trusts\nFixed portfolio\nRedeemable at NAV\nUnmanaged\n\n\n\nOpen-end mutual funds are the most familiar type. They issue new shares when investors want to buy and redeem shares when investors want to sell, always at net asset value calculated at the end of each trading day. Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that then trade on an exchange like stocks. Their market prices can diverge from NAV, sometimes trading at a premium and sometimes at a discount, creating puzzles that have fascinated researchers for decades.\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) combine features of both. Like closed-end funds, they trade on exchanges throughout the day. But unlike closed-end funds, an arbitrage mechanism involving authorized participants keeps their prices close to NAV. ETFs have become enormously popular due to their tax efficiency, low costs, and trading flexibility.\n\n\n3.3 Net Asset Value\nNet asset value (NAV) is the per-share value of a fund’s holdings, calculated as:\n\\[\\text{NAV} = \\frac{\\text{Market Value of Assets} - \\text{Liabilities}}{\\text{Shares Outstanding}}\\]\nFor open-end funds, NAV is calculated once daily after markets close, and all transactions that day occur at that price. This differs from stocks, where prices fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours.\n\n\n3.4 The Critical Role of Fees\nFees deserve careful attention because they compound relentlessly over time, creating a substantial drag on returns. Understanding the fee structure is essential for evaluating any fund.\n\n\n\nFee Type\nWhen Charged\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nFront-end load\nAt purchase\nReduces initial investment\n\n\nBack-end load\nAt redemption\nDiscourages early exit\n\n\n12b-1 fees\nAnnual\nMarketing/distribution costs\n\n\nExpense ratio\nAnnual\nManagement + operating costs\n\n\n\nFront-end loads take a percentage of your investment immediately—a 5% load means only $950 of your $1,000 actually gets invested. Back-end loads are charged when you sell, often declining over time to encourage longer holding periods. Annual expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and 12b-1 distribution fees, are deducted from fund assets continuously.\nThe impact of annual expenses is often underestimated. A 1% annual expense ratio might sound modest, but over 20 years it reduces terminal wealth by approximately 18%. Over 30 years, the difference is even more dramatic. This is why low-cost index funds have such an inherent advantage—they’re not fighting against the headwind of high expenses.\n\n\n3.5 Fund Categories\nFunds are categorized by their investment policies. Money market funds invest in short-term, high-quality debt and maintain a stable $1 NAV. Equity funds span the spectrum from conservative large-cap value funds to aggressive small-cap growth funds, with sector funds, international funds, and index funds offering further variety. Bond funds similarly range from safe government bond funds to risky high-yield (junk bond) funds. Balanced or hybrid funds hold both stocks and bonds, offering built-in diversification across asset classes.\n\n\n3.6 Active versus Passive Management\nThe choice between active and passive management is one of the most consequential decisions an investor makes. Active managers attempt to beat their benchmark through superior security selection and market timing. They employ analysts, conduct research, and trade frequently, all of which costs money. Passive managers simply seek to match benchmark returns by holding an index portfolio, minimizing costs and turnover.\nThe empirical evidence strongly favors passive management for most investors. In any given year, roughly half of active managers underperform their benchmarks before fees and substantially more than half underperform after fees. Over longer horizons, the percentage of active managers who beat their benchmarks shrinks further. Past performance provides little help in identifying future winners. This doesn’t mean skilled managers don’t exist—some almost certainly do—but identifying them in advance is extraordinarily difficult.\n\n\n3.7 The Rise of ETFs\nExchange-traded funds have grown explosively because they offer compelling advantages. Unlike mutual funds, which price only once daily, ETFs trade throughout the day, allowing investors to react quickly to market developments. ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds because of their unique structure: when investors want to exit, they sell on the exchange rather than redeeming from the fund, so the fund doesn’t need to sell holdings and realize capital gains. Most ETFs are passively managed index funds with rock-bottom expense ratios, though actively managed ETFs are increasingly available."

    "text": "2 The Three-Step Framework\nOptimal asset allocation proceeds in three distinct steps, each building on the previous one. Understanding why we separate the problem this way—rather than solving everything at once—reveals deep insights about how risk and return interact in portfolio construction.\nStep 1 involves finding the tangency portfolio, which combines your risky assets in a way that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. This step is sometimes called finding the “optimal risky portfolio.” The remarkable insight here is that this step depends only on the statistical properties of the risky assets—their expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations—and not at all on how risk-averse you are. Whether you are a conservative investor who loses sleep over small losses or an aggressive investor comfortable with large swings, the same tangency portfolio is optimal for you.\nStep 2 involves finding the optimal capital allocation—that is, deciding what fraction of your total wealth to invest in the tangency portfolio from Step 1, with the remainder going into a risk-free asset. This step is where your personal risk tolerance enters the picture. A more risk-averse investor will allocate less to the tangency portfolio and hold more in the risk-free asset, while a less risk-averse investor will do the opposite.\nStep 3 simply combines the results from the first two steps. If Step 2 tells you to put 60% of your wealth in the tangency portfolio, and Step 1 tells you that Stock A should be 40% of the tangency portfolio, then your final allocation to Stock A is \\(0.60 \\times 0.40 = 0.24\\), or 24% of your total wealth.\nThis separation is elegant because it means you can solve the technical optimization problem (finding the best Sharpe ratio) without knowing anything about the investor, and then customize the solution for any particular investor’s risk preferences."

    "section": "6 The Two-Asset Special Case",
    "text": "6 The Two-Asset Special Case\nWhile the general formulas above work for any number of risky assets, examining the special case of just two risky assets builds important intuition. This case is also practically significant because your “assets” don’t have to be individual stocks—they can be diversified portfolios. For example, you might think of Asset A as a total stock market ETF (like SPY) and Asset B as a total bond market ETF (like BND). In this framing, the optimal asset allocation problem becomes the classic stocks-bonds-cash allocation decision that every investor faces.\n\n6.1 Step 1 with Two Assets\nWhen there are only two risky assets, A and B, the tangency portfolio weights have a closed-form solution. The weight on asset A is:\n\\[w_{A,\\text{tan}} = \\frac{(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]}{(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f)\\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]}\\]\nThe weight on asset B is simply \\(w_{B,\\text{tan}} = 1 - w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\).\nWhile this formula looks intimidating at first, notice what it captures: the optimal weight in asset A depends on both assets’ risk premiums, both assets’ variances, and their covariance. Assets with higher risk premiums get more weight, assets with higher variance get less weight (all else equal), and the covariance term captures how the assets interact.\n\n\n6.2 Step 2 with Two Assets\nThe capital allocation formula remains the same:\n\\[w_{\\text{oca}} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_P^2}\\]\nHowever, we now compute the tangency portfolio’s expected return and variance using the two-asset formulas:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_{A,\\text{tan}} E[R_A] + w_{B,\\text{tan}} E[R_B]\\]\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = w_{A,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_{B,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_{A,\\text{tan}} w_{B,\\text{tan}} \\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\]\n\n\n6.3 Step 3 with Two Assets\nThe final allocation places:\n\n\n\nAsset\nFinal Portfolio Weight\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free asset\n\\(1 - w_{\\text{oca}}\\)\n\n\nRisky asset A\n\\(w_{\\text{oca}} \\times w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\)\n\n\nRisky asset B\n\\(w_{\\text{oca}} \\times w_{B,\\text{tan}}\\)\n\n\n\nExample: Allocating Between Two Stocks and the Risk-Free Asset\nYou want to invest in Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) and the risk-free asset but are not sure how much to invest in each. You have estimated that the expected returns of FB and NFLX are 10% and 15% respectively, their standard deviations are 20% and 25% respectively, and their covariance is 0.02. The risk-free rate is 5%. Find the optimal asset allocation between the three assets assuming that your risk-aversion coefficient is 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\n\nParameter\nFB (Asset A)\nNFLX (Asset B)\n\n\n\n\nExpected return\n\\(E[R_A] = 10\\%\\)\n\\(E[R_B] = 15\\%\\)\n\n\nStandard deviation\n\\(\\sigma_A = 20\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_B = 25\\%\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma_A^2 = 0.04\\)\n\\(\\sigma_B^2 = 0.0625\\)\n\n\n\nAdditional parameters: \\(\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B] = 0.02\\), \\(R_f = 5\\%\\), and \\(A = 5\\).\nStep 1: Find the tangency portfolio weights\nFirst, we compute the risk premiums (excess returns):\n\nFB risk premium: \\(E[R_A] - R_f = 10\\% - 5\\% = 5\\% = 0.05\\)\nNFLX risk premium: \\(E[R_B] - R_f = 15\\% - 5\\% = 10\\% = 0.10\\)\n\nNow we apply the two-asset tangency weight formula. Let’s compute the numerator and denominator separately:\nNumerator for \\(w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\): \\[(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.05)(0.0625) - (0.10)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.003125 - 0.002 = 0.001125\\]\nDenominator: \\[(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f)\\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.05)(0.0625) + (0.10)(0.04) - (0.05 + 0.10)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.003125 + 0.004 - 0.003 = 0.004125\\]\nTherefore: \\[w_{A,\\text{tan}} = \\frac{0.001125}{0.004125} = 0.2727 \\approx 27.27\\%\\]\n\\[w_{B,\\text{tan}} = 1 - 0.2727 = 0.7273 \\approx 72.73\\%\\]\nThe tangency portfolio consists of 27.27% in FB and 72.73% in NFLX.\nStep 2: Find the optimal capital allocation\nFirst, we need the expected return and variance of the tangency portfolio:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_{A,\\text{tan}} E[R_A] + w_{B,\\text{tan}} E[R_B]\\] \\[= (0.2727)(0.10) + (0.7273)(0.15) = 0.02727 + 0.10909 = 0.1364 = 13.64\\%\\]\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = w_{A,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_{B,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_{A,\\text{tan}} w_{B,\\text{tan}} \\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.2727)^2(0.04) + (0.7273)^2(0.0625) + 2(0.2727)(0.7273)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.00297 + 0.03306 + 0.00793 = 0.04396\\]\nThe tangency portfolio has an expected return of 13.64% and variance of 0.04396 (standard deviation of 20.97%).\nNow we apply the capital allocation formula: \\[w_{\\text{oca}} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_P^2} = \\frac{0.1364 - 0.05}{5 \\times 0.04396} = \\frac{0.0864}{0.2198} = 0.393 \\approx 39.3\\%\\]\nAn investor with risk aversion of 5 should put 39.3% of their wealth in the tangency portfolio and 60.7% in the risk-free asset.\nStep 3: The complete asset allocation\n\n\n\nAsset\nCalculation\nFinal Weight\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free asset\n\\(1 - 0.393\\)\n60.7%\n\n\nFB\n\\(0.393 \\times 0.2727\\)\n10.7%\n\n\nNFLX\n\\(0.393 \\times 0.7273\\)\n28.6%\n\n\nTotal\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\nThe optimal allocation for this investor is to put 60.7% in the risk-free asset, 10.7% in Facebook, and 28.6% in Netflix.\nInterpretation: Even though the tangency portfolio is heavily weighted toward the higher-returning NFLX (72.73%), this moderately risk-averse investor only commits about 39% of their wealth to the risky portfolio, resulting in a final allocation that is dominated by the safe asset."

    "section": "7 Key Takeaways",
    "text": "7 Key Takeaways\nThe optimal asset allocation framework provides a systematic approach to one of investing’s most fundamental decisions: how to divide wealth among available investment opportunities. The key insight is that this complex problem can be decomposed into two simpler problems that are solved sequentially and then combined.\nThe first problem—finding the tangency portfolio—is purely technical. It asks: given the expected returns, risks, and correlations of our risky assets, what combination delivers the highest Sharpe ratio? This problem has the same solution regardless of who is investing; a conservative retiree and an aggressive young professional would hold their risky assets in exactly the same proportions. The tangency portfolio represents the most efficient way to harvest the risk premium available in the market.\nThe second problem—capital allocation—is where personal circumstances enter. Here we ask: how much risk should this particular investor take? The answer depends on the investor’s risk aversion coefficient, which captures their willingness to accept volatility in exchange for higher expected returns. More risk-averse investors tilt toward the safety of the risk-free asset, while less risk-averse investors lean into the tangency portfolio.\nThe final step simply multiplies these decisions together. If the tangency portfolio says “hold 40% in stocks,” and capital allocation says “hold 60% in the risky portfolio,” then stocks get 24% of total wealth. This multiplicative structure explains why even an investor with a stock-heavy tangency portfolio might end up with a conservative overall allocation if their risk aversion is high.\nThe two-asset case, while simplified, captures the essential logic and has direct practical applications. When the two “assets” are broad market portfolios—such as a stock index and a bond index—this framework guides the classic stocks-bonds-cash allocation decision. The mathematics tells us not only that diversification across asset classes is beneficial, but precisely how much to hold in each category given our risk tolerance and market expectations."

    "text": "9 Practice Problems\nExample: A Conservative Investor’s Allocation\nConsider the same two assets from the previous example (FB with expected return 10% and standard deviation 20%, and NFLX with expected return 15% and standard deviation 25%, covariance 0.02, risk-free rate 5%). Now suppose the investor has a risk-aversion coefficient of 10 instead of 5. Find the optimal asset allocation for this more risk-averse investor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Find the tangency portfolio weights\nThe tangency portfolio weights do not depend on risk aversion, so they are the same as before:\n\n\\(w_{A,\\text{tan}} = 27.27\\%\\) (FB)\n\\(w_{B,\\text{tan}} = 72.73\\%\\) (NFLX)\n\nStep 2: Find the optimal capital allocation\nThe tangency portfolio statistics are also unchanged:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 13.64\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_P^2 = 0.04396\\)\n\nBut now we use \\(A = 10\\):\n\\[w_{\\text{oca}} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_P^2} = \\frac{0.1364 - 0.05}{10 \\times 0.04396} = \\frac{0.0864}{0.4396} = 0.197 \\approx 19.7\\%\\]\nThis more risk-averse investor should put only 19.7% in the tangency portfolio, compared to 39.3% for the investor with \\(A = 5\\).\nStep 3: The complete asset allocation\n\n\n\nAsset\nCalculation\nFinal Weight\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free asset\n\\(1 - 0.197\\)\n80.3%\n\n\nFB\n\\(0.197 \\times 0.2727\\)\n5.4%\n\n\nNFLX\n\\(0.197 \\times 0.7273\\)\n14.3%\n\n\nTotal\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Doubling the risk aversion (from 5 to 10) approximately halves the allocation to risky assets.

Note that the composition of the risky portion (the split between FB and NFLX) remains unchanged—only the size of the risky position changes with risk aversion."

    "section": "2 The Three-Step Framework",
    "text": "2 The Three-Step Framework\nOptimal asset allocation proceeds in three distinct steps, each building on the previous one. Understanding why we separate the problem this way—rather than solving everything at once—reveals deep insights about how risk and return interact in portfolio construction.\nStep 1 involves finding the tangency portfolio, which combines your risky assets in a way that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. This step is sometimes called finding the “optimal risky portfolio.” The remarkable insight here is that this step depends only on the statistical properties of the risky assets—their expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations—and not at all on how risk-averse you are. Whether you are a conservative investor who loses sleep over small losses or an aggressive investor comfortable with large swings, the same tangency portfolio is optimal for you.\nStep 2 involves finding the optimal capital allocation—that is, deciding what fraction of your total wealth to invest in the tangency portfolio from Step 1, with the remainder going into a risk-free asset. This step is where your personal risk tolerance enters the picture. A more risk-averse investor will allocate less to the tangency portfolio and hold more in the risk-free asset, while a less risk-averse investor will do the opposite.\nStep 3 simply combines the results from the first two steps. If Step 2 tells you to put 60% of your wealth in the tangency portfolio, and Step 1 tells you that Stock A should be 40% of the tangency portfolio, then your final allocation to Stock A is \\(0.60 \\times 0.40 = 0.24\\), or 24% of your total wealth.\nThis separation is elegant because it means you can solve the technical optimization problem (finding the best Sharpe ratio) without knowing anything about the investor, and then customize the solution for any particular investor’s risk preferences."

    "section": "6 The Two-Asset Special Case",
    "text": "6 The Two-Asset Special Case\nWhile the general formulas above work for any number of risky assets, examining the special case of just two risky assets builds important intuition. This case is also practically significant because your “assets” don’t have to be individual stocks—they can be diversified portfolios. For example, you might think of Asset A as a total stock market ETF (like SPY) and Asset B as a total bond market ETF (like BND). In this framing, the optimal asset allocation problem becomes the classic stocks-bonds-cash allocation decision that every investor faces.\n\n6.1 Step 1 with Two Assets\nWhen there are only two risky assets, A and B, the tangency portfolio weights have a closed-form solution. The weight on asset A is:\n\\[w_{A,\\text{tan}} = \\frac{(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]}{(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f)\\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]}\\]\nThe weight on asset B is simply \\(w_{B,\\text{tan}} = 1 - w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\).\nWhile this formula looks intimidating at first, notice what it captures: the optimal weight in asset A depends on both assets’ risk premiums, both assets’ variances, and their covariance. Assets with higher risk premiums get more weight, assets with higher variance get less weight (all else equal), and the covariance term captures how the assets interact.\n\n\n6.2 Step 2 with Two Assets\nThe capital allocation formula remains the same:\n\\[w_{\\text{oca}} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_P^2}\\]\nHowever, we now compute the tangency portfolio’s expected return and variance using the two-asset formulas:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_{A,\\text{tan}} E[R_A] + w_{B,\\text{tan}} E[R_B]\\]\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = w_{A,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_{B,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_{A,\\text{tan}} w_{B,\\text{tan}} \\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\]\n\n\n6.3 Step 3 with Two Assets\nThe final allocation places:\n\n\n\nAsset\nFinal Portfolio Weight\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free asset\n\\(1 - w_{\\text{oca}}\\)\n\n\nRisky asset A\n\\(w_{\\text{oca}} \\times w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\)\n\n\nRisky asset B\n\\(w_{\\text{oca}} \\times w_{B,\\text{tan}}\\)\n\n\n\nExample: Allocating Between Two Stocks and the Risk-Free Asset\nYou want to invest in Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) and the risk-free asset but are not sure how much to invest in each. You have estimated that the expected returns of FB and NFLX are 10% and 15% respectively, their standard deviations are 20% and 25% respectively, and their covariance is 0.02. The risk-free rate is 5%. Find the optimal asset allocation between the three assets assuming that your risk-aversion coefficient is 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\n\nParameter\nFB (Asset A)\nNFLX (Asset B)\n\n\n\n\nExpected return\n\\(E[R_A] = 10\\%\\)\n\\(E[R_B] = 15\\%\\)\n\n\nStandard deviation\n\\(\\sigma_A = 20\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_B = 25\\%\\)\n\n\nVariance\n\\(\\sigma_A^2 = 0.04\\)\n\\(\\sigma_B^2 = 0.0625\\)\n\n\n\nAdditional parameters: \\(\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B] = 0.02\\), \\(R_f = 5\\%\\), and \\(A = 5\\).\nStep 1: Find the tangency portfolio weights\nFirst, we compute the risk premiums (excess returns):\n\nFB risk premium: \\(E[R_A] - R_f = 10\\% - 5\\% = 5\\% = 0.05\\)\nNFLX risk premium: \\(E[R_B] - R_f = 15\\% - 5\\% = 10\\% = 0.10\\)\n\nNow we apply the two-asset tangency weight formula. Let’s compute the numerator and denominator separately:\nNumerator for \\(w_{A,\\text{tan}}\\): \\[(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.05)(0.0625) - (0.10)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.003125 - 0.002 = 0.001125\\]\nDenominator: \\[(E[R_A] - R_f)\\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f)\\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.05)(0.0625) + (0.10)(0.04) - (0.05 + 0.10)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.003125 + 0.004 - 0.003 = 0.004125\\]\nTherefore: \\[w_{A,\\text{tan}} = \\frac{0.001125}{0.004125} = 0.2727 \\approx 27.27\\%\\]\n\\[w_{B,\\text{tan}} = 1 - 0.2727 = 0.7273 \\approx 72.73\\%\\]\nThe tangency portfolio consists of 27.27% in FB and 72.73% in NFLX.\nStep 2: Find the optimal capital allocation\nFirst, we need the expected return and variance of the tangency portfolio:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_{A,\\text{tan}} E[R_A] + w_{B,\\text{tan}} E[R_B]\\] \\[= (0.2727)(0.10) + (0.7273)(0.15) = 0.02727 + 0.10909 = 0.1364 = 13.64\\%\\]\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = w_{A,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_{B,\\text{tan}}^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_{A,\\text{tan}} w_{B,\\text{tan}} \\text{Cov}[R_A, R_B]\\] \\[= (0.2727)^2(0.04) + (0.7273)^2(0.0625) + 2(0.2727)(0.7273)(0.02)\\] \\[= 0.00297 + 0.03306 + 0.00793 = 0.04396\\]\nThe tangency portfolio has an expected return of 13.64% and variance of 0.04396 (standard deviation of 20.97%).\nNow we apply the capital allocation formula: \\[w_{\\text{oca}} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A \\sigma_P^2} = \\frac{0.1364 - 0.05}{5 \\times 0.04396} = \\frac{0.0864}{0.2198} = 0.393 \\approx 39.3\\%\\]\nAn investor with risk aversion of 5 should put 39.3% of their wealth in the tangency portfolio and 60.7% in the risk-free asset.\nStep 3: The complete asset allocation\n\n\n\nAsset\nCalculation\nFinal Weight\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free asset\n\\(1 - 0.393\\)\n60.7%\n\n\nFB\n\\(0.393 \\times 0.2727\\)\n10.7%\n\n\nNFLX\n\\(0.393 \\times 0.7273\\)\n28.6%\n\n\nTotal\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\nThe optimal allocation for this investor is to put 60.7% in the risk-free asset, 10.7% in Facebook, and 28.6% in Netflix.\nInterpretation: Even though the tangency portfolio is heavily weighted toward the higher-returning NFLX (72.73%), this moderately risk-averse investor only commits about 39% of their wealth to the risky portfolio, resulting in a final allocation that is dominated by the safe asset."

    "section": "7 Key Takeaways",
    "text": "7 Key Takeaways\nThe optimal asset allocation framework provides a systematic approach to one of investing’s most fundamental decisions: how to divide wealth among available investment opportunities. The key insight is that this complex problem can be decomposed into two simpler problems that are solved sequentially and then combined.\nThe first problem—finding the tangency portfolio—is purely technical. It asks: given the expected returns, risks, and correlations of our risky assets, what combination delivers the highest Sharpe ratio? This problem has the same solution regardless of who is investing; a conservative retiree and an aggressive young professional would hold their risky assets in exactly the same proportions. The tangency portfolio represents the most efficient way to harvest the risk premium available in the market.\nThe second problem—capital allocation—is where personal circumstances enter. Here we ask: how much risk should this particular investor take? The answer depends on the investor’s risk aversion coefficient, which captures their willingness to accept volatility in exchange for higher expected returns. More risk-averse investors tilt toward the safety of the risk-free asset, while less risk-averse investors lean into the tangency portfolio.\nThe final step simply multiplies these decisions together. If the tangency portfolio says “hold 40% in stocks,” and capital allocation says “hold 60% in the risky portfolio,” then stocks get 24% of total wealth. This multiplicative structure explains why even an investor with a stock-heavy tangency portfolio might end up with a conservative overall allocation if their risk aversion is high.\nThe two-asset case, while simplified, captures the essential logic and has direct practical applications. When the two “assets” are broad market portfolios—such as a stock index and a bond index—this framework guides the classic stocks-bonds-cash allocation decision. The mathematics tells us not only that diversification across asset classes is beneficial, but precisely how much to hold in each category given our risk tolerance and market expectations."

    "section": "2 The Normal Distribution",
    "text": "2 The Normal Distribution\nBefore we can measure risk and return, we need a framework for thinking about uncertain outcomes. In finance, we model future returns as random variables—quantities whose values are determined by chance according to some probability distribution. The most important distribution in finance is the normal distribution (also called the Gaussian distribution), and understanding its properties is essential for everything that follows.\nThe normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is completely characterized by just two parameters: its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and its standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). The mean tells us where the center of the distribution lies—the expected value of the random variable. The standard deviation tells us how spread out the distribution is around that center—how much uncertainty there is about the outcome.\nMathematically, if a random variable \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), we write \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). The probability density function is:\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\]\nWhile you don’t need to memorize this formula, it’s important to understand what it implies. The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, meaning returns above the mean are just as likely as returns below it. About 68% of outcomes fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% fall within three standard deviations. These percentages are crucial for interpreting risk.\n\n\n\nInterval\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma\\)\n68.3%\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\\)\n95.4%\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma\\)\n99.7%\n\n\n\nWhy does the normal distribution matter so much in finance? First, it arises naturally when many small, independent factors combine to produce an outcome—which is arguably what happens when thousands of traders and information sources influence a stock’s price. Second, it provides a tractable mathematical framework: if we know the mean and standard deviation, we know everything about the distribution. Third, many statistical procedures assume normality, and even when returns aren’t perfectly normal, the approximation is often good enough for practical purposes.\nThe key insight is this: if returns are normally distributed, then standard deviation completely captures the risk of an investment. A higher standard deviation means more uncertainty—both on the upside and the downside. This is why standard deviation (also called volatility in finance) becomes our primary measure of risk.\nExample: Interpreting Normal Returns\nSuppose returns on a stock are normally distributed with a mean of 8% per year and a standard deviation of 15%. What is the probability that returns will be negative in a given year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to find \\(P(R &lt; 0)\\) where \\(R \\sim N(0.08, 0.15^2)\\).\nFirst, standardize by converting to a z-score: \\[z = \\frac{0 - 0.08}{0.15} = \\frac{-0.08}{0.15} = -0.533\\]\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, \\(P(Z &lt; -0.533) \\approx 0.297\\).\nTherefore, there is approximately a 29.7% probability that returns will be negative in any given year. This illustrates an important point: even with a positive expected return of 8%, there is still a substantial chance of losing money due to volatility."

    "section": "3 Sample Mean and Standard Deviation",
    "text": "3 Sample Mean and Standard Deviation\nInvestments are fundamentally about future rewards. We hope to find investments that will deliver high returns, but because we cannot perfectly predict the future, uncertainty accompanies every investment. To pursue some expected return, we must expose ourselves to risk—the possibility that we will lose money. The goal is to find investments that we believe will provide a good risk-return tradeoff: a high expected return per unit of risk.\nTo make good investment decisions, we need to estimate the risk-return tradeoff that different investments offer. This requires estimating both the expected return and the risk. We approach this by thinking of future returns as random variables: the future return is an unknown quantity that takes values according to some probability distribution. The mean of that distribution represents the expected return, and the standard deviation measures the risk because it quantifies uncertainty in our predictions.\nBut the mean and standard deviation of future returns are unknown—they are parameters of a distribution we cannot directly observe. To estimate them, we make a critical assumption: past returns came from the same probability distribution as future returns. If this assumption holds reasonably well, we can use historical data to estimate what we might expect going forward.\nGiven \\(N\\) observations of past returns on an investment (call them \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_N\\)), we compute:\nThe sample mean: \\[\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{N} R_t = \\frac{R_1 + R_2 + \\cdots + R_N}{N}\\]\nThe sample variance: \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{N}(R_t - \\bar{R})^2 = \\frac{(R_1 - \\bar{R})^2 + (R_2 - \\bar{R})^2 + \\cdots + (R_N - \\bar{R})^2}{N-1}\\]\nThe sample standard deviation: \\[s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\]\nA few important notes on these formulas. First, we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\) when calculating variance. This adjustment, called Bessel’s correction, produces an unbiased estimate of the population variance. Second, the standard deviation has the same units as returns (percent), making it more interpretable than variance (percent squared). Third, these are estimates—they are calculated from a finite sample and therefore subject to sampling error. More data generally produces more reliable estimates.\nThe sample mean serves as our estimate of expected return, while the sample standard deviation serves as our estimate of volatility or total risk. Together, they form the foundation for evaluating investments.\nExample: Estimating Expected Return and Risk\nSuppose over the past four months, TSLA had returns of 10%, 5%, -5%, and 14% respectively. Using this data alone, estimate the expected return and risk for TSLA’s next month’s return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the sample mean\n\\[\\bar{R} = \\frac{10\\% + 5\\% + (-5\\%) + 14\\%}{4} = \\frac{24\\%}{4} = 6\\%\\]\nStep 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nReturn (\\(R_t\\))\nDeviation (\\(R_t - \\bar{R}\\))\nSquared Deviation\n\n\n\n\n1\n10%\n10% - 6% = 4%\n16%²\n\n\n2\n5%\n5% - 6% = -1%\n1%²\n\n\n3\n-5%\n-5% - 6% = -11%\n121%²\n\n\n4\n14%\n14% - 6% = 8%\n64%²\n\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sample variance\n\\[s^2 = \\frac{16 + 1 + 121 + 64}{4-1} = \\frac{202}{3} = 67.33\\%^2\\]\nStep 4: Calculate the sample standard deviation\n\\[s = \\sqrt{67.33\\%^2} = 8.21\\%\\]\nBased on this historical data, our estimate for TSLA’s expected monthly return is 6% and our estimate for its monthly volatility (risk) is 8.21%."

    "section": "4 The Risk-Free Rate, Excess Returns, and Risk Premia",
    "text": "4 The Risk-Free Rate, Excess Returns, and Risk Premia\nTo properly evaluate the reward from a risky investment, we need a benchmark—something to compare against. That benchmark is the return we could earn with absolute certainty: the risk-free rate.\nThe only investment that is truly risk-free is a short-term U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill). The U.S. government is considered certain to repay its short-term obligations, so a 1-month or 3-month T-bill carries essentially zero default risk. For this course, we use the 1-month T-bill rate as our risk-free rate, denoted \\(R_f\\).\nBecause the T-bill is riskless, its return is known with certainty at the time of purchase. This means its expected return equals its yield, and its standard deviation is zero:\n\n\n\nProperty\nValue\n\n\n\n\nExpected return\n\\(E[R_f] = R_f\\)\n\n\nStandard deviation\n\\(\\sigma(R_f) = 0\\)\n\n\n\nThe risk-free rate matters because it represents the opportunity cost of taking on risk. If you can earn 4% with certainty by buying T-bills, then a risky investment must offer more than 4% in expectation to be worth considering. The additional expected return above the risk-free rate is the compensation for bearing risk.\nThe excess return on investment \\(i\\) in a given period is the difference between its return and the risk-free rate:\n\\[\\text{Excess Return}_i = R_i - R_f\\]\nExcess returns measure how much better (or worse) a risky investment performed compared to the safe alternative. They can be positive or negative in any given period.\nThe risk premium on investment \\(i\\) is the expected excess return:\n\\[\\text{Risk Premium}_i = E[R_i] - R_f\\]\nThe risk premium represents the expected compensation for bearing the investment’s risk. Unlike excess returns (which vary period to period), the risk premium is a forward-looking concept about what we expect to earn, on average, above the risk-free rate.\nInvestors demand positive risk premia to hold risky assets. No rational investor would accept risk without expecting higher returns. The size of the risk premium reflects both the amount of risk and how that risk is priced by the market.\nExample: Calculating Excess Returns and Risk Premium\nSuppose returns on TSLA over the past 3 months were 10% (most recent), 5%, and -3%, while the 1-month T-bill yields were 0.1% (most recent), 0.2%, and 0.3% respectively. Calculate the excess returns over the past 3 months and estimate TSLA’s risk premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate excess returns for each month\n\n\n\nMonth\nTSLA Return\nT-bill Rate\nExcess Return\n\n\n\n\n1 (oldest)\n-3%\n0.3%\n-3% - 0.3% = -3.3%\n\n\n2\n5%\n0.2%\n5% - 0.2% = 4.8%\n\n\n3 (recent)\n10%\n0.1%\n10% - 0.1% = 9.9%\n\n\n\nThe excess returns were -3.3%, 4.8%, and 9.9% respectively.\nStep 2: Estimate the risk premium\nThe risk premium is the expected excess return. We estimate it using the average of historical excess returns:\n\\[\\text{Risk Premium} = \\frac{-3.3\\% + 4.8\\% + 9.9\\%}{3} = \\frac{11.4\\%}{3} = 3.8\\%\\]\nOur estimate of TSLA’s monthly risk premium is 3.8%—the expected monthly return above the risk-free rate that compensates investors for holding this risky stock."

    "section": "5 Mean-Variance Analysis and the Sharpe Ratio",
    "text": "5 Mean-Variance Analysis and the Sharpe Ratio\nMean-variance analysis is the process of evaluating investments based on their expected returns and risk (as measured by standard deviation or variance). An investor who cares only about these two characteristics—seeking higher expected returns and lower risk—is called a mean-variance optimizer.\nThis framework, developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, makes a simplifying assumption: investors don’t care about other characteristics of returns, such as skewness or the specific source of risk. While real investors might also consider factors like liquidity, tax implications, or environmental impact, mean-variance analysis provides a powerful and tractable starting point. For this course, we assume the marginal investor—loosely, the “typical” investor whose preferences are reflected in market prices—is a mean-variance optimizer.\nIf investors are mean-variance optimizers, how do they compare investments with different combinations of risk and return? An investment with 12% expected return and 20% volatility might be better or worse than one with 8% expected return and 10% volatility—it depends on how we weigh return against risk.\nThe Sharpe ratio provides the answer. Named after William Sharpe, it measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment by calculating how much excess return you receive per unit of volatility:\n\\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_i = \\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{\\sigma(R_i)}\\]\nwhere \\(E[R_i]\\) is the expected return on investment \\(i\\), \\(R_f\\) is the risk-free rate, and \\(\\sigma(R_i)\\) is the standard deviation of returns.\nThe Sharpe ratio has an elegant interpretation: it tells you how much expected return above the risk-free rate you earn for each percentage point of volatility you accept. An investment with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 delivers 0.5% of expected excess return for every 1% of volatility. Higher is better.\nWhy focus on excess return rather than total return in the numerator? Because the risk-free rate is the baseline—it’s what you could earn without taking any risk. Only the excess return represents compensation for bearing risk, so only the excess return should be compared to the amount of risk taken.\nThe Sharpe ratio allows us to compare investments on a common scale. An investment with high expected return but very high volatility might have a lower Sharpe ratio than a more modest investment with low volatility. For mean-variance optimizers, the investment with the higher Sharpe ratio is preferred.\nExample: Choosing Between Investments\nYou can only invest in either TSLA or AAPL. TSLA has an expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 12%. AAPL has an expected return of 7% and standard deviation of 6%. The 1-month T-bill yields 1%. If you are a mean-variance optimizer, which stock should you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Sharpe ratio for each stock:\nFor TSLA: \\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_{TSLA} = \\frac{10\\% - 1\\%}{12\\%} = \\frac{9\\%}{12\\%} = 0.75\\]\nFor AAPL: \\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_{AAPL} = \\frac{7\\% - 1\\%}{6\\%} = \\frac{6\\%}{6\\%} = 1.00\\]\nDecision:\nAlthough TSLA has a higher expected return (10% vs. 7%), AAPL has the higher Sharpe ratio (1.00 vs. 0.75). This means AAPL provides more expected excess return per unit of risk.\nAs a mean-variance optimizer, you should choose AAPL. You earn 1% of risk premium for every 1% of volatility with AAPL, compared to only 0.75% with TSLA. AAPL offers a better risk-return tradeoff."

    "text": "6 Key Takeaways\nThe concepts in this lecture form an interconnected framework for thinking about investment decisions. We began with the normal distribution because it provides the theoretical justification for using standard deviation as our measure of risk—when returns are normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation completely characterize the distribution of outcomes, and we can make precise probability statements about how likely different returns are to occur.\nThe practical challenge is that we cannot directly observe the parameters of the return distribution. We must estimate them from historical data, computing sample means and standard deviations under the assumption that the past is informative about the future. These estimates are imperfect, but they give us a starting point for evaluating investments.\nThe risk-free rate provides our benchmark for evaluation. Since we can always earn the T-bill rate with certainty, only returns above this threshold represent compensation for bearing risk. This leads us to focus on excess returns and risk premia—the additional returns we expect for accepting uncertainty.\nThe Sharpe ratio brings everything together by expressing the risk-return tradeoff as a single number: expected excess return per unit of volatility. For mean-variance optimizers, investments with higher Sharpe ratios are unambiguously better. This metric will remain central as we extend our analysis to portfolios and consider how combining investments affects risk and return."

    "section": "2 The Normal Distribution",
    "text": "2 The Normal Distribution\nBefore we can measure risk and return, we need a framework for thinking about uncertain outcomes. In finance, we model future returns as random variables—quantities whose values are determined by chance according to some probability distribution. The most important distribution in finance is the normal distribution (also called the Gaussian distribution), and understanding its properties is essential for everything that follows.\nThe normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is completely characterized by just two parameters: its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and its standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). The mean tells us where the center of the distribution lies—the expected value of the random variable. The standard deviation tells us how spread out the distribution is around that center—how much uncertainty there is about the outcome.\nMathematically, if a random variable \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), we write \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). The probability density function is:\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\]\nWhile you don’t need to memorize this formula, it’s important to understand what it implies. The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, meaning returns above the mean are just as likely as returns below it. About 68% of outcomes fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% fall within three standard deviations. These percentages are crucial for interpreting risk.\n\n\n\nInterval\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma\\)\n68.3%\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\\)\n95.4%\n\n\n\\(\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma\\)\n99.7%\n\n\n\nWhy does the normal distribution matter so much in finance? First, it arises naturally when many small, independent factors combine to produce an outcome—which is arguably what happens when thousands of traders and information sources influence a stock’s price. Second, it provides a tractable mathematical framework: if we know the mean and standard deviation, we know everything about the distribution. Third, many statistical procedures assume normality, and even when returns aren’t perfectly normal, the approximation is often good enough for practical purposes.\nThe key insight is this: if returns are normally distributed, then standard deviation completely captures the risk of an investment. A higher standard deviation means more uncertainty—both on the upside and the downside. This is why standard deviation (also called volatility in finance) becomes our primary measure of risk.\nExample: Interpreting Normal Returns\nSuppose returns on a stock are normally distributed with a mean of 8% per year and a standard deviation of 15%. What is the probability that returns will be negative in a given year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to find \\(P(R &lt; 0)\\) where \\(R \\sim N(0.08, 0.15^2)\\).\nFirst, standardize by converting to a z-score: \\[z = \\frac{0 - 0.08}{0.15} = \\frac{-0.08}{0.15} = -0.533\\]\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, \\(P(Z &lt; -0.533) \\approx 0.297\\).\nTherefore, there is approximately a 29.7% probability that returns will be negative in any given year. This illustrates an important point: even with a positive expected return of 8%, there is still a substantial chance of losing money due to volatility."

    "section": "3 Sample Mean and Standard Deviation",
    "text": "3 Sample Mean and Standard Deviation\nInvestments are fundamentally about future rewards. We hope to find investments that will deliver high returns, but because we cannot perfectly predict the future, uncertainty accompanies every investment. To pursue some expected return, we must expose ourselves to risk—the possibility that we will lose money. The goal is to find investments that we believe will provide a good risk-return tradeoff: a high expected return per unit of risk.\nTo make good investment decisions, we need to estimate the risk-return tradeoff that different investments offer. This requires estimating both the expected return and the risk. We approach this by thinking of future returns as random variables: the future return is an unknown quantity that takes values according to some probability distribution. The mean of that distribution represents the expected return, and the standard deviation measures the risk because it quantifies uncertainty in our predictions.\nBut the mean and standard deviation of future returns are unknown—they are parameters of a distribution we cannot directly observe. To estimate them, we make a critical assumption: past returns came from the same probability distribution as future returns. If this assumption holds reasonably well, we can use historical data to estimate what we might expect going forward.\nGiven \\(N\\) observations of past returns on an investment (call them \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_N\\)), we compute:\nThe sample mean: \\[\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{N} R_t = \\frac{R_1 + R_2 + \\cdots + R_N}{N}\\]\nThe sample variance: \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{N}(R_t - \\bar{R})^2 = \\frac{(R_1 - \\bar{R})^2 + (R_2 - \\bar{R})^2 + \\cdots + (R_N - \\bar{R})^2}{N-1}\\]\nThe sample standard deviation: \\[s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\]\nA few important notes on these formulas. First, we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\) when calculating variance. This adjustment, called Bessel’s correction, produces an unbiased estimate of the population variance. Second, the standard deviation has the same units as returns (percent), making it more interpretable than variance (percent squared). Third, these are estimates—they are calculated from a finite sample and therefore subject to sampling error. More data generally produces more reliable estimates.\nThe sample mean serves as our estimate of expected return, while the sample standard deviation serves as our estimate of volatility or total risk. Together, they form the foundation for evaluating investments.\nExample: Estimating Expected Return and Risk\nSuppose over the past four months, TSLA had returns of 10%, 5%, -5%, and 14% respectively. Using this data alone, estimate the expected return and risk for TSLA’s next month’s return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the sample mean\n\\[\\bar{R} = \\frac{10\\% + 5\\% + (-5\\%) + 14\\%}{4} = \\frac{24\\%}{4} = 6\\%\\]\nStep 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nReturn (\\(R_t\\))\nDeviation (\\(R_t - \\bar{R}\\))\nSquared Deviation\n\n\n\n\n1\n10%\n10% - 6% = 4%\n16%²\n\n\n2\n5%\n5% - 6% = -1%\n1%²\n\n\n3\n-5%\n-5% - 6% = -11%\n121%²\n\n\n4\n14%\n14% - 6% = 8%\n64%²\n\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sample variance\n\\[s^2 = \\frac{16 + 1 + 121 + 64}{4-1} = \\frac{202}{3} = 67.33\\%^2\\]\nStep 4: Calculate the sample standard deviation\n\\[s = \\sqrt{67.33\\%^2} = 8.21\\%\\]\nBased on this historical data, our estimate for TSLA’s expected monthly return is 6% and our estimate for its monthly volatility (risk) is 8.21%."

    "text": "4 The Risk-Free Rate, Excess Returns, and Risk Premia\nTo properly evaluate the reward from a risky investment, we need a benchmark—something to compare against. That benchmark is the return we could earn with absolute certainty: the risk-free rate.\nThe only investment that is truly risk-free is a short-term U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill). The U.S. government is considered certain to repay its short-term obligations, so a 1-month or 3-month T-bill carries essentially zero default risk. For this course, we use the 1-month T-bill rate as our risk-free rate, denoted \\(R_f\\).\nBecause the T-bill is riskless, its return is known with certainty at the time of purchase. This means its expected return equals its yield, and its standard deviation is zero:\n\n\n\nProperty\nValue\n\n\n\n\nExpected return\n\\(E[R_f] = R_f\\)\n\n\nStandard deviation\n\\(\\sigma(R_f) = 0\\)\n\n\n\nThe risk-free rate matters because it represents the opportunity cost of taking on risk. If you can earn 4% with certainty by buying T-bills, then a risky investment must offer more than 4% in expectation to be worth considering. The additional expected return above the risk-free rate is the compensation for bearing risk.\nThe excess return on investment \\(i\\) in a given period is the difference between its return and the risk-free rate:\n\\[\\text{Excess Return}_i = R_i - R_f\\]\nExcess returns measure how much better (or worse) a risky investment performed compared to the safe alternative. They can be positive or negative in any given period.\nThe risk premium on investment \\(i\\) is the expected excess return:\n\\[\\text{Risk Premium}_i = E[R_i] - R_f\\]\nThe risk premium represents the expected compensation for bearing the investment’s risk. Unlike excess returns (which vary period to period), the risk premium is a forward-looking concept about what we expect to earn, on average, above the risk-free rate.\nInvestors demand positive risk premia to hold risky assets. No rational investor would accept risk without expecting higher returns. The size of the risk premium reflects both the amount of risk and how that risk is priced by the market.\nExample: Calculating Excess Returns and Risk Premium\nSuppose returns on TSLA over the past 3 months were 10% (most recent), 5%, and -3%, while the 1-month T-bill yields were 0.1% (most recent), 0.2%, and 0.3% respectively. Calculate the excess returns over the past 3 months and estimate TSLA’s risk premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate excess returns for each month\n\n\n\nMonth\nTSLA Return\nT-bill Rate\nExcess Return\n\n\n\n\n1 (oldest)\n-3%\n0.3%\n-3% - 0.3% = -3.3%\n\n\n2\n5%\n0.2%\n5% - 0.2% = 4.8%\n\n\n3 (recent)\n10%\n0.1%\n10% - 0.1% = 9.9%\n\n\n\nThe excess returns were -3.3%, 4.8%, and 9.9% respectively.\nStep 2: Estimate the risk premium\nThe risk premium is the expected excess return. We estimate it using the average of historical excess returns:\n\\[\\text{Risk Premium} = \\frac{-3.3\\% + 4.8\\% + 9.9\\%}{3} = \\frac{11.4\\%}{3} = 3.8\\%\\]\nOur estimate of TSLA’s monthly risk premium is 3.8%—the expected monthly return above the risk-free rate that compensates investors for holding this risky stock."

    "section": "5 Mean-Variance Analysis and the Sharpe Ratio",
    "text": "5 Mean-Variance Analysis and the Sharpe Ratio\nMean-variance analysis is the process of evaluating investments based on their expected returns and risk (as measured by standard deviation or variance). An investor who cares only about these two characteristics—seeking higher expected returns and lower risk—is called a mean-variance optimizer.\nThis framework, developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, makes a simplifying assumption: investors don’t care about other characteristics of returns, such as skewness or the specific source of risk. While real investors might also consider factors like liquidity, tax implications, or environmental impact, mean-variance analysis provides a powerful and tractable starting point. For this course, we assume the marginal investor—loosely, the “typical” investor whose preferences are reflected in market prices—is a mean-variance optimizer.\nIf investors are mean-variance optimizers, how do they compare investments with different combinations of risk and return? An investment with 12% expected return and 20% volatility might be better or worse than one with 8% expected return and 10% volatility—it depends on how we weigh return against risk.\nThe Sharpe ratio provides the answer. Named after William Sharpe, it measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment by calculating how much excess return you receive per unit of volatility:\n\\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_i = \\frac{E[R_i] - R_f}{\\sigma(R_i)}\\]\nwhere \\(E[R_i]\\) is the expected return on investment \\(i\\), \\(R_f\\) is the risk-free rate, and \\(\\sigma(R_i)\\) is the standard deviation of returns.\nThe Sharpe ratio has an elegant interpretation: it tells you how much expected return above the risk-free rate you earn for each percentage point of volatility you accept. An investment with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 delivers 0.5% of expected excess return for every 1% of volatility. Higher is better.\nWhy focus on excess return rather than total return in the numerator? Because the risk-free rate is the baseline—it’s what you could earn without taking any risk. Only the excess return represents compensation for bearing risk, so only the excess return should be compared to the amount of risk taken.\nThe Sharpe ratio allows us to compare investments on a common scale. An investment with high expected return but very high volatility might have a lower Sharpe ratio than a more modest investment with low volatility. For mean-variance optimizers, the investment with the higher Sharpe ratio is preferred.\nExample: Choosing Between Investments\nYou can only invest in either TSLA or AAPL. TSLA has an expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 12%. AAPL has an expected return of 7% and standard deviation of 6%. The 1-month T-bill yields 1%. If you are a mean-variance optimizer, which stock should you choose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Sharpe ratio for each stock:\nFor TSLA: \\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_{TSLA} = \\frac{10\\% - 1\\%}{12\\%} = \\frac{9\\%}{12\\%} = 0.75\\]\nFor AAPL: \\[\\text{Sharpe Ratio}_{AAPL} = \\frac{7\\% - 1\\%}{6\\%} = \\frac{6\\%}{6\\%} = 1.00\\]\nDecision:\nAlthough TSLA has a higher expected return (10% vs. 7%), AAPL has the higher Sharpe ratio (1.00 vs. 0.75). This means AAPL provides more expected excess return per unit of risk.\nAs a mean-variance optimizer, you should choose AAPL. You earn 1% of risk premium for every 1% of volatility with AAPL, compared to only 0.75% with TSLA. AAPL offers a better risk-return tradeoff."

    "text": "6 Key Takeaways\nThe concepts in this lecture form an interconnected framework for thinking about investment decisions. We began with the normal distribution because it provides the theoretical justification for using standard deviation as our measure of risk—when returns are normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation completely characterize the distribution of outcomes, and we can make precise probability statements about how likely different returns are to occur.\nThe practical challenge is that we cannot directly observe the parameters of the return distribution. We must estimate them from historical data, computing sample means and standard deviations under the assumption that the past is informative about the future. These estimates are imperfect, but they give us a starting point for evaluating investments.\nThe risk-free rate provides our benchmark for evaluation. Since we can always earn the T-bill rate with certainty, only returns above this threshold represent compensation for bearing risk. This leads us to focus on excess returns and risk premia—the additional returns we expect for accepting uncertainty.\nThe Sharpe ratio brings everything together by expressing the risk-return tradeoff as a single number: expected excess return per unit of volatility. For mean-variance optimizers, investments with higher Sharpe ratios are unambiguously better. This metric will remain central as we extend our analysis to portfolios and consider how combining investments affects risk and return."

    "section": "2 The Capital Allocation Line (CAL)",
    "text": "2 The Capital Allocation Line (CAL)\n\n2.1 Constructing the Complete Portfolio\nSuppose you have identified a risky asset (or portfolio of risky assets) that you want to invest in—call it P. This could be a single stock like Tesla, an index fund tracking the S&P 500, or a carefully constructed portfolio of multiple securities. Alongside P, you have access to a risk-free asset, such as a U.S. Treasury bill, which offers a guaranteed return.\nThe central question of capital allocation is: what fraction of your wealth should you invest in P versus the risk-free asset? We denote this fraction as \\(w_c\\), where the subscript “c” stands for “complete portfolio”—the final portfolio containing both risky and risk-free components. If you invest proportion \\(w_c\\) in the risky asset P, then the remaining proportion \\((1 - w_c)\\) goes into the risk-free asset.\nYour complete portfolio C has a return that is simply the weighted average of the returns on its two components:\n\\[R_C = w_c R_P + (1 - w_c) R_f\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the return on the risky asset and \\(R_f\\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n\n2.2 Expected Return of the Complete Portfolio\nTaking expectations of both sides, we find the expected return of the complete portfolio:\n\\[E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1 - w_c) R_f\\]\nNotice something important here: we wrote \\(R_f\\) rather than \\(E[R_f]\\) for the risk-free component. This is because the risk-free asset, by definition, has no uncertainty about its return—it’s guaranteed by the U.S. government. A constant has no randomness, so its expected value equals itself.\nThis formula tells us that we can achieve any expected return between \\(R_f\\) (when \\(w_c = 0\\)) and \\(E[R_P]\\) (when \\(w_c = 1\\)) by choosing the appropriate weight. We can even achieve expected returns above \\(E[R_P]\\) by setting \\(w_c &gt; 1\\), which means borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest more than 100% of our wealth in the risky asset—a strategy called leveraging.\n\n\n2.3 Risk of the Complete Portfolio\nWhat about the risk of our complete portfolio? Using the formula for the variance of a weighted sum of random variables:\n\\[\\text{Var}[R_C] = w_c^2 \\text{Var}[R_P] + (1-w_c)^2 \\text{Var}[R_f] + 2w_c(1-w_c)\\text{Cov}[R_P, R_f]\\]\nHere’s where the special nature of the risk-free asset simplifies things dramatically. Because \\(R_f\\) is a constant (not a random variable), its variance is zero and its covariance with any other random variable is also zero. Substituting \\(\\text{Var}[R_f] = 0\\) and \\(\\text{Cov}[R_P, R_f] = 0\\), we get:\n\\[\\text{Var}[R_C] = w_c^2 \\text{Var}[R_P]\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us the standard deviation of the complete portfolio:\n\\[\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\]\nThis result is elegant and intuitive: the risk of your complete portfolio is simply your allocation to the risky asset multiplied by that asset’s risk. If you put half your money in the risky asset, you bear half its risk. If you leverage to 150% in the risky asset, you bear 1.5 times its risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Constructing Capital Allocations\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you have estimated that the expected return on TSLA is 10% and the standard deviation of its future returns is 12%. The risk-free rate is 1%. Create capital allocations with weights in TSLA ranging from 0% to 200% in increments of 10%. Calculate the expected return and standard deviation for each complete portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWe apply the formulas \\(E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1 - w_c) R_f\\) and \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\) for each weight.\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 10\\%\\) (expected return on TSLA)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 12\\%\\) (standard deviation of TSLA)\n\\(R_f = 1\\%\\) (risk-free rate)\n\nCalculations:\nFor \\(w_c = 0\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 0(0.10) + 1(0.01) = 1\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 0(0.12) = 0\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 50\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 0.5(0.10) + 0.5(0.01) = 5.5\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 0.5(0.12) = 6\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 100\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 1(0.10) + 0(0.01) = 10\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 1(0.12) = 12\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 150\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 1.5(0.10) + (-0.5)(0.01) = 14.5\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 1.5(0.12) = 18\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 200\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 2(0.10) + (-1)(0.01) = 19\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 2(0.12) = 24\\%\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight in TSLA (\\(w_c\\))\nWeight in Risk-Free\nExpected Return\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n0%\n100%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n\n\n10%\n90%\n1.9%\n1.2%\n\n\n20%\n80%\n2.8%\n2.4%\n\n\n30%\n70%\n3.7%\n3.6%\n\n\n40%\n60%\n4.6%\n4.8%\n\n\n50%\n50%\n5.5%\n6.0%\n\n\n60%\n40%\n6.4%\n7.2%\n\n\n70%\n30%\n7.3%\n8.4%\n\n\n80%\n20%\n8.2%\n9.6%\n\n\n90%\n10%\n9.1%\n10.8%\n\n\n100%\n0%\n10.0%\n12.0%\n\n\n110%\n-10%\n10.9%\n13.2%\n\n\n120%\n-20%\n11.8%\n14.4%\n\n\n130%\n-30%\n12.7%\n15.6%\n\n\n140%\n-40%\n13.6%\n16.8%\n\n\n150%\n-50%\n14.5%\n18.0%\n\n\n160%\n-60%\n15.4%\n19.2%\n\n\n170%\n-70%\n16.3%\n20.4%\n\n\n180%\n-80%\n17.2%\n21.6%\n\n\n190%\n-90%\n18.1%\n22.8%\n\n\n200%\n-100%\n19.0%\n24.0%\n\n\n\nWhen plotted in mean-volatility space (with standard deviation on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis), these points form a straight line starting at \\((0\\%, 1\\%)\\) and passing through \\((12\\%, 10\\%)\\).

    "section": "3 Characteristics of the Capital Allocation Line",
    "text": "3 Characteristics of the Capital Allocation Line\n\n3.1 The Geometry of Risk-Return Trade-offs\nThe calculations in Example 1 reveal something remarkable: all possible complete portfolios lie on a straight line in mean-volatility space. This line is called the Capital Allocation Line (CAL), and understanding its properties gives us deep insight into the risk-return trade-off available to investors.\nEvery risky asset (or portfolio) has its own CAL. The line always starts at the point \\((0, R_f)\\)—representing 100% investment in the risk-free asset—and extends upward and to the right through the point \\((\\sigma_P, E[R_P])\\)—representing 100% investment in the risky asset. Beyond this point, the line continues into the leveraged region where \\(w_c &gt; 1\\).\n\n\n3.2 The Slope of the CAL: The Sharpe Ratio\nThe slope of any straight line is “rise over run.” For the CAL, the rise is the increase in expected return, and the run is the increase in standard deviation. Using two points on the line—the risk-free asset at \\((0, R_f)\\) and the risky asset at \\((\\sigma_P, E[R_P])\\)—we find:\n\\[\\text{Slope of CAL} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{\\sigma_P}\\]\nThis ratio has a name you’ll encounter constantly in finance: the Sharpe ratio. It measures the excess return (return above the risk-free rate) per unit of risk. The Sharpe ratio tells you how much extra return you earn for each additional percentage point of volatility you accept.\nA higher Sharpe ratio means a steeper CAL, which means better risk-return trade-offs. If two risky assets have the same expected return but different volatilities, the less volatile one has a higher Sharpe ratio and a more attractive CAL. This is why the Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used performance metrics in investment management.\n\n\n3.3 The Analytical Equation for the CAL\nWe can express the expected return of any complete portfolio as a function of its standard deviation by rearranging our formulas. Since \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\), we have \\(w_c = \\sigma_C / \\sigma_P\\). Substituting this into the expected return formula:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{\\sigma_P}\\]\nOr more compactly:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\nThis equation is powerful because it tells us the exact relationship between risk and expected return for our complete portfolio. Given the Sharpe ratio of our risky asset, we can immediately calculate what expected return we’ll earn for any level of risk we choose to take on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Using the CAL Equation\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you want to invest in TSLA and a risk-free asset (a 3-month T-bill). You have estimated that the Sharpe ratio of TSLA stock is 0.5. The yield on the 3-month T-bill is 0.4%. You would like the complete portfolio (made up of TSLA and the 3-month T-bill) to give you an expected return of 5.4%. What will be the total risk (standard deviation) of the complete portfolio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the CAL equation to find the standard deviation that corresponds to our target expected return.\nGiven information:\n\nSharpe ratio of TSLA = 0.5\n\\(R_f = 0.4\\%\\)\nTarget \\(E[R_C] = 5.4\\%\\)\n\nSetting up the equation:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\n\\[5.4\\% = 0.4\\% + \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\nSolving for \\(\\sigma_C\\):\n\\[5.4\\% - 0.4\\% = \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[5.0\\% = \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{5.0\\%}{0.5} = 10\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nTo achieve an expected return of 5.4%, you must accept a portfolio standard deviation of 10%.\nWe can verify this makes sense by finding the implied weight in TSLA. First, we need TSLA’s volatility. Since Sharpe ratio = \\((E[R_P] - R_f)/\\sigma_P\\) and we know the Sharpe ratio is 0.5, we can work backwards: if the Sharpe ratio is 0.5 and \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P = 10\\%\\), then \\(w_c = \\sigma_C / \\sigma_P = 10\\% / \\sigma_P\\).\nAlternatively, using \\(E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1-w_c)R_f\\) and the fact that the excess return of 5% must come entirely from TSLA’s excess return: \\(w_c \\times (E[R_P] - R_f) = 5\\%\\), and since Sharpe ratio \\(= 0.5 = (E[R_P] - R_f)/\\sigma_P\\), we have \\((E[R_P] - R_f) = 0.5 \\sigma_P\\).\nThe key result is that the CAL tells us precisely what risk level we must accept for any given target return."

    "section": "4 Optimal Capital Allocation",
    "text": "4 Optimal Capital Allocation\nWe now know how to calculate the risk and expected return of any complete portfolio given a capital allocation weight \\(w_c\\). But this raises a crucial question: how should we choose \\(w_c\\)? The answer depends fundamentally on how the investor feels about risk.\n\n4.1 Understanding Risk Aversion\nDifferent people have different attitudes toward risk. Consider a simple thought experiment: I offer you a choice between (A) receiving $50 for certain, or (B) flipping a fair coin where you win $100 if heads and $0 if tails. Both options have the same expected value of $50, but option B involves risk while option A does not.\nMost people prefer option A—the certain $50. This preference for certainty when expected values are equal is called risk aversion. A risk-averse person requires compensation (in the form of higher expected returns) to accept risk. The more risk-averse someone is, the more compensation they demand.\nSome people might be indifferent between A and B—these are risk-neutral individuals who care only about expected value, not about risk. And a few might actually prefer B—these are risk-seeking individuals who enjoy the thrill of uncertainty.\nIn financial markets, most investors are risk-averse. This is why risky assets must offer higher expected returns than risk-free assets—the extra return is the compensation that risk-averse investors demand for bearing uncertainty.\n\n\n4.2 Quantifying Risk Aversion: The Utility Function\nTo make optimal decisions, we need a way to quantify how much an investor dislikes risk. Economists and financial theorists do this using a utility function—a mathematical function that converts portfolio characteristics into a single number representing the investor’s satisfaction or “utility.”\nThe most common utility function in finance is the mean-variance utility function (sometimes called quadratic utility):\n\\[U = E[R] - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2\\]\nHere, \\(U\\) represents the investor’s utility (satisfaction) from a portfolio with expected return \\(E[R]\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The parameter \\(A\\) is the coefficient of risk aversion—it measures how much the investor dislikes variance.\nLet’s unpack this formula. The first term, \\(E[R]\\), says that investors like higher expected returns—this increases utility. The second term, \\(-\\frac{1}{2}A\\sigma^2\\), says that investors dislike variance—this decreases utility. The coefficient \\(A\\) determines how severely variance is penalized relative to expected return.\nFor a risk-averse investor, \\(A &gt; 0\\). Higher values of \\(A\\) mean greater risk aversion—the investor penalizes variance more heavily and requires more expected return to compensate for a given level of risk. For a risk-neutral investor, \\(A = 0\\), and the utility function reduces to just the expected return. For a risk-seeking investor, \\(A &lt; 0\\), but this case is rare and not our focus.\n\n\n4.3 Interpreting the Risk Aversion Coefficient\nWhat does a risk aversion coefficient of, say, \\(A = 4\\) actually mean? One intuitive interpretation comes from thinking about certainty equivalents.\nImagine asking an investor: “If you were to invest all your wealth in a risky asset with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), what is the minimum expected return you would require to make the investment worthwhile compared to earning the risk-free rate?”\nIf the investor answers that they require an expected return of \\(E[R]\\), and they’re indifferent between this risky investment and the risk-free alternative, then their risk aversion coefficient is:\n\\[A = \\frac{E[R] - R_f}{\\sigma^2}\\]\nFor example, if an investor requires an expected return of 10% to hold an asset with variance of 0.04 (standard deviation of 20%) when the risk-free rate is 2%, their risk aversion coefficient is:\n\\[A = \\frac{0.10 - 0.02}{0.04} = \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2\\]\nCommon values of \\(A\\) in practice range from about 2 to 6, with 4 being a frequently used “moderate” value. An investor with \\(A = 2\\) is relatively tolerant of risk, while \\(A = 6\\) indicates significant risk aversion.\n\n\n4.4 Deriving the Optimal Capital Allocation\nNow we can solve for the optimal capital allocation. The investor wants to choose the weight \\(w_c\\) that maximizes their utility. Substituting our formulas for the complete portfolio into the utility function:\n\\[U = E[R_C] - \\frac{1}{2}A\\sigma_C^2\\]\n\\[U = w_c E[R_P] + (1-w_c)R_f - \\frac{1}{2}A(w_c\\sigma_P)^2\\]\n\\[U = R_f + w_c(E[R_P] - R_f) - \\frac{1}{2}Aw_c^2\\sigma_P^2\\]\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to \\(w_c\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dU}{dw_c} = (E[R_P] - R_f) - Aw_c\\sigma_P^2 = 0\\]\nSolving for \\(w_c\\) gives us the optimal capital allocation:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2}\\]\nThis elegant formula tells us exactly what proportion of our wealth to invest in the risky asset as a function of three things: the risky asset’s risk premium \\((E[R_P] - R_f)\\), the investor’s risk aversion \\((A)\\), and the risky asset’s variance \\((\\sigma_P^2)\\).\n\n\n4.5 Understanding the Optimal Allocation Formula\nThe formula makes intuitive sense on several levels. The optimal allocation to risky assets increases with the risk premium—if the expected excess return is higher, you should invest more. The allocation decreases with risk aversion—more risk-averse investors hold less in risky assets. And the allocation decreases with variance—riskier assets warrant smaller positions.\nNotice that the formula uses variance \\((\\sigma_P^2)\\) in the denominator, not standard deviation \\((\\sigma_P)\\). This is because the utility function penalizes variance, and the mathematics of optimization naturally produces this result. It means that the allocation is very sensitive to risk: doubling the standard deviation quadruples the variance and thus reduces the optimal allocation by a factor of four.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Finding the Optimal Capital Allocation\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you have estimated that the expected return on TSLA is 5.6% and the standard deviation of its future returns is 18.6%. The risk-free rate is 0.1%. Your coefficient of risk aversion is 4. What is your optimal capital allocation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWe apply the optimal capital allocation formula directly.\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 5.6\\%\\) (expected return on TSLA)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 18.6\\%\\) (standard deviation of TSLA)\n\\(R_f = 0.1\\%\\) (risk-free rate)\n\\(A = 4\\) (coefficient of risk aversion)\n\nCalculate the variance:\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = (0.186)^2 = 0.0346\\]\nApply the optimal capital allocation formula:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.056 - 0.001}{4 \\times 0.0346}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.055}{0.1384}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = 0.397 \\approx 39.7\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nGiven your risk aversion of 4, you should invest approximately 39.7% of your wealth in TSLA and the remaining 60.3% in the risk-free asset.\nWhat would change with different risk aversion?\n\nIf \\(A = 2\\) (less risk-averse): \\(w^*_c = 0.055/(2 \\times 0.0346) = 79.5\\%\\)\nIf \\(A = 6\\) (more risk-averse): \\(w^*_c = 0.055/(6 \\times 0.0346) = 26.5\\%\\)\n\nThis illustrates how dramatically risk aversion affects the optimal allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Important Limitations\nThe optimal capital allocation formula we’ve derived assumes that the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_P\\) correctly measures the risk you’re exposed to from investing in P. This is true if P is your only investment—if your complete portfolio C represents your entire wealth.\nHowever, if you own other assets and P becomes just one component of a larger overall portfolio, the formula may not apply directly. That’s because much of P’s total risk (\\(\\sigma_P\\)) will be diversified away when combined with other assets. In that case, what matters is not P’s total risk, but its contribution to the risk of your overall portfolio—a concept we’ll explore when we study portfolio diversification.\nFor now, think of the optimal capital allocation formula as applicable when you’re deciding how to split your investable wealth between a single risky portfolio P and the risk-free asset, where P represents your entire exposure to risky assets."

    "text": "5 Key Takeaways\nThe framework we’ve developed in this lecture provides the foundation for one of the most important decisions in investing: how much risk to take. By combining a risky asset with a risk-free asset, investors can create complete portfolios anywhere along the Capital Allocation Line, trading off between the safety of the risk-free rate and the higher expected returns (but also higher volatility) of risky assets.\nThe CAL is characterized by its slope, which equals the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset. This ratio—excess return per unit of risk—serves as a universal measure of the quality of the risk-return trade-off. Higher Sharpe ratios mean steeper CALs and better investment opportunities. The CAL equation \\(E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\) allows us to translate any target expected return into the corresponding risk level, or vice versa.\nThe question of where to position yourself along the CAL depends on your risk aversion, captured by the coefficient \\(A\\) in the mean-variance utility function. This utility function formalizes the trade-off between wanting higher expected returns and disliking risk. By maximizing utility, we derived the optimal capital allocation formula, which tells us exactly what fraction of wealth to invest in risky assets given the risk premium, our risk aversion, and the asset’s variance.\nThese concepts connect to nearly everything else in investments. The Sharpe ratio will reappear when we evaluate portfolio performance and when we study how to construct the best possible risky portfolio. Risk aversion underlies asset pricing models that explain why different securities have different expected returns. And the principle of optimal capital allocation extends naturally to multi-asset portfolios, where the challenge becomes finding the best risky portfolio P before deciding how much to allocate to it."

    "text": "7 Practice Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 1: Capital Allocation Calculations\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are considering investing in an S&P 500 index fund. Based on historical data and your analysis, you estimate the expected return of the index fund to be 8% with a standard deviation of 16%. The current yield on 1-year Treasury bills is 3%. Calculate the expected return and standard deviation for complete portfolios with weights of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 125% in the index fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 1\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 8\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 16\\%\\)\n\\(R_f = 3\\%\\)\n\nApplying the formulas:\nFor each weight \\(w_c\\):\n\n\\(E[R_C] = w_c(8\\%) + (1-w_c)(3\\%)\\)\n\\(\\sigma_C = w_c(16\\%)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight (\\(w_c\\))\nExpected Return \\(E[R_C]\\)\nStandard Deviation \\(\\sigma_C\\)\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\\(0(8\\%) + 1(3\\%) = 3.0\\%\\)\n\\(0(16\\%) = 0\\%\\)\n\n\n25%\n\\(0.25(8\\%) + 0.75(3\\%) = 4.25\\%\\)\n\\(0.25(16\\%) = 4\\%\\)\n\n\n50%\n\\(0.5(8\\%) + 0.5(3\\%) = 5.5\\%\\)\n\\(0.5(16\\%) = 8\\%\\)\n\n\n75%\n\\(0.75(8\\%) + 0.25(3\\%) = 6.75\\%\\)\n\\(0.75(16\\%) = 12\\%\\)\n\n\n100%\n\\(1(8\\%) + 0(3\\%) = 8.0\\%\\)\n\\(1(16\\%) = 16\\%\\)\n\n\n125%\n\\(1.25(8\\%) - 0.25(3\\%) = 9.25\\%\\)\n\\(1.25(16\\%) = 20\\%\\)\n\n\n\nThe 125% allocation involves borrowing 25% of your wealth at the risk-free rate to invest 125% in the index fund. Notice that both expected return and standard deviation increase linearly with the weight in the risky asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 2: Using the CAL to Find Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investor is considering a diversified equity portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 0.4. The current risk-free rate is 2%. If the investor wants to achieve an expected return of 6% on their complete portfolio, what standard deviation must they accept? What if they wanted a 10% expected return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 2\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\nSharpe ratio = 0.4\n\\(R_f = 2\\%\\)\nTarget expected returns: 6% and 10%\n\nUsing the CAL equation:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\sigma_C\\):\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{E[R_C] - R_f}{\\text{Sharpe Ratio}}\\]\nFor 6% expected return:\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{6\\% - 2\\%}{0.4} = \\frac{4\\%}{0.4} = 10\\%\\]\nFor 10% expected return:\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{10\\% - 2\\%}{0.4} = \\frac{8\\%}{0.4} = 20\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nTo achieve 6% expected return, the investor must accept a 10% standard deviation. To achieve 10% expected return, they must accept 20% standard deviation—twice the risk for twice the excess return. This linear relationship is the essence of the Capital Allocation Line.\nNote that for the 10% expected return case, the investor would need to leverage (borrow at the risk-free rate) because they’re taking on more risk than the underlying risky portfolio likely has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 3: Optimal Allocation with Different Risk Aversion\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider an emerging markets equity fund with an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation of 28%. The risk-free rate is 2%. Calculate the optimal capital allocation for three investors with risk aversion coefficients of A = 2, A = 4, and A = 8. Comment on how risk aversion affects the optimal allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 3\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 12\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 28\\%\\)\n\\(R_f = 2\\%\\)\nRisk aversion coefficients: A = 2, 4, and 8\n\nCalculate the variance:\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = (0.28)^2 = 0.0784\\]\nCalculate the risk premium:\n\\[E[R_P] - R_f = 12\\% - 2\\% = 10\\% = 0.10\\]\nApply the optimal capital allocation formula for each investor:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2} = \\frac{0.10}{A \\times 0.0784}\\]\nFor A = 2 (low risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{2 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.1568} = 0.638 = 63.8\\%\\]\nFor A = 4 (moderate risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{4 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.3136} = 0.319 = 31.9\\%\\]\nFor A = 8 (high risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{8 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.6272} = 0.159 = 15.9\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Aversion (A)\nOptimal Weight in Risky Asset\nWeight in Risk-Free Asset\n\n\n\n\n2\n63.8%\n36.2%\n\n\n4\n31.9%\n68.1%\n\n\n8\n15.9%\n84.1%\n\n\n\nCommentary:\nDoubling the risk aversion coefficient exactly halves the optimal allocation to the risky asset. This is because \\(A\\) appears in the denominator of the formula. The least risk-averse investor (A = 2) allocates nearly two-thirds of their wealth to the volatile emerging markets fund, while the most risk-averse investor (A = 8) keeps more than 80% in the safety of risk-free assets. This dramatic difference illustrates why understanding your client’s (or your own) risk tolerance is so crucial for portfolio construction."

    "section": "2 The Capital Allocation Line (CAL)",
    "text": "2 The Capital Allocation Line (CAL)\n\n2.1 Constructing the Complete Portfolio\nSuppose you have identified a risky asset (or portfolio of risky assets) that you want to invest in—call it P. This could be a single stock like Tesla, an index fund tracking the S&P 500, or a carefully constructed portfolio of multiple securities. Alongside P, you have access to a risk-free asset, such as a U.S. Treasury bill, which offers a guaranteed return.\nThe central question of capital allocation is: what fraction of your wealth should you invest in P versus the risk-free asset? We denote this fraction as \\(w_c\\), where the subscript “c” stands for “complete portfolio”—the final portfolio containing both risky and risk-free components. If you invest proportion \\(w_c\\) in the risky asset P, then the remaining proportion \\((1 - w_c)\\) goes into the risk-free asset.\nYour complete portfolio C has a return that is simply the weighted average of the returns on its two components:\n\\[R_C = w_c R_P + (1 - w_c) R_f\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the return on the risky asset and \\(R_f\\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n\n2.2 Expected Return of the Complete Portfolio\nTaking expectations of both sides, we find the expected return of the complete portfolio:\n\\[E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1 - w_c) R_f\\]\nNotice something important here: we wrote \\(R_f\\) rather than \\(E[R_f]\\) for the risk-free component. This is because the risk-free asset, by definition, has no uncertainty about its return—it’s guaranteed by the U.S. government. A constant has no randomness, so its expected value equals itself.\nThis formula tells us that we can achieve any expected return between \\(R_f\\) (when \\(w_c = 0\\)) and \\(E[R_P]\\) (when \\(w_c = 1\\)) by choosing the appropriate weight. We can even achieve expected returns above \\(E[R_P]\\) by setting \\(w_c &gt; 1\\), which means borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest more than 100% of our wealth in the risky asset—a strategy called leveraging.\n\n\n2.3 Risk of the Complete Portfolio\nWhat about the risk of our complete portfolio? Using the formula for the variance of a weighted sum of random variables:\n\\[\\text{Var}[R_C] = w_c^2 \\text{Var}[R_P] + (1-w_c)^2 \\text{Var}[R_f] + 2w_c(1-w_c)\\text{Cov}[R_P, R_f]\\]\nHere’s where the special nature of the risk-free asset simplifies things dramatically. Because \\(R_f\\) is a constant (not a random variable), its variance is zero and its covariance with any other random variable is also zero. Substituting \\(\\text{Var}[R_f] = 0\\) and \\(\\text{Cov}[R_P, R_f] = 0\\), we get:\n\\[\\text{Var}[R_C] = w_c^2 \\text{Var}[R_P]\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us the standard deviation of the complete portfolio:\n\\[\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\]\nThis result is elegant and intuitive: the risk of your complete portfolio is simply your allocation to the risky asset multiplied by that asset’s risk. If you put half your money in the risky asset, you bear half its risk. If you leverage to 150% in the risky asset, you bear 1.5 times its risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Constructing Capital Allocations\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you have estimated that the expected return on TSLA is 10% and the standard deviation of its future returns is 12%. The risk-free rate is 1%. Create capital allocations with weights in TSLA ranging from 0% to 200% in increments of 10%. Calculate the expected return and standard deviation for each complete portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWe apply the formulas \\(E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1 - w_c) R_f\\) and \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\) for each weight.\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 10\\%\\) (expected return on TSLA)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 12\\%\\) (standard deviation of TSLA)\n\\(R_f = 1\\%\\) (risk-free rate)\n\nCalculations:\nFor \\(w_c = 0\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 0(0.10) + 1(0.01) = 1\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 0(0.12) = 0\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 50\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 0.5(0.10) + 0.5(0.01) = 5.5\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 0.5(0.12) = 6\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 100\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 1(0.10) + 0(0.01) = 10\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 1(0.12) = 12\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 150\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 1.5(0.10) + (-0.5)(0.01) = 14.5\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 1.5(0.12) = 18\\%\\)\nFor \\(w_c = 200\\%\\): \\(E[R_C] = 2(0.10) + (-1)(0.01) = 19\\%\\), \\(\\sigma_C = 2(0.12) = 24\\%\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight in TSLA (\\(w_c\\))\nWeight in Risk-Free\nExpected Return\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n0%\n100%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n\n\n10%\n90%\n1.9%\n1.2%\n\n\n20%\n80%\n2.8%\n2.4%\n\n\n30%\n70%\n3.7%\n3.6%\n\n\n40%\n60%\n4.6%\n4.8%\n\n\n50%\n50%\n5.5%\n6.0%\n\n\n60%\n40%\n6.4%\n7.2%\n\n\n70%\n30%\n7.3%\n8.4%\n\n\n80%\n20%\n8.2%\n9.6%\n\n\n90%\n10%\n9.1%\n10.8%\n\n\n100%\n0%\n10.0%\n12.0%\n\n\n110%\n-10%\n10.9%\n13.2%\n\n\n120%\n-20%\n11.8%\n14.4%\n\n\n130%\n-30%\n12.7%\n15.6%\n\n\n140%\n-40%\n13.6%\n16.8%\n\n\n150%\n-50%\n14.5%\n18.0%\n\n\n160%\n-60%\n15.4%\n19.2%\n\n\n170%\n-70%\n16.3%\n20.4%\n\n\n180%\n-80%\n17.2%\n21.6%\n\n\n190%\n-90%\n18.1%\n22.8%\n\n\n200%\n-100%\n19.0%\n24.0%\n\n\n\nWhen plotted in mean-volatility space (with standard deviation on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis), these points form a straight line starting at \\((0\\%, 1\\%)\\) and passing through \\((12\\%, 10\\%)\\).

    "section": "3 Characteristics of the Capital Allocation Line",
    "text": "3 Characteristics of the Capital Allocation Line\n\n3.1 The Geometry of Risk-Return Trade-offs\nThe calculations in Example 1 reveal something remarkable: all possible complete portfolios lie on a straight line in mean-volatility space. This line is called the Capital Allocation Line (CAL), and understanding its properties gives us deep insight into the risk-return trade-off available to investors.\nEvery risky asset (or portfolio) has its own CAL. The line always starts at the point \\((0, R_f)\\)—representing 100% investment in the risk-free asset—and extends upward and to the right through the point \\((\\sigma_P, E[R_P])\\)—representing 100% investment in the risky asset. Beyond this point, the line continues into the leveraged region where \\(w_c &gt; 1\\).\n\n\n3.2 The Slope of the CAL: The Sharpe Ratio\nThe slope of any straight line is “rise over run.” For the CAL, the rise is the increase in expected return, and the run is the increase in standard deviation. Using two points on the line—the risk-free asset at \\((0, R_f)\\) and the risky asset at \\((\\sigma_P, E[R_P])\\)—we find:\n\\[\\text{Slope of CAL} = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{\\sigma_P}\\]\nThis ratio has a name you’ll encounter constantly in finance: the Sharpe ratio. It measures the excess return (return above the risk-free rate) per unit of risk. The Sharpe ratio tells you how much extra return you earn for each additional percentage point of volatility you accept.\nA higher Sharpe ratio means a steeper CAL, which means better risk-return trade-offs. If two risky assets have the same expected return but different volatilities, the less volatile one has a higher Sharpe ratio and a more attractive CAL. This is why the Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used performance metrics in investment management.\n\n\n3.3 The Analytical Equation for the CAL\nWe can express the expected return of any complete portfolio as a function of its standard deviation by rearranging our formulas. Since \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P\\), we have \\(w_c = \\sigma_C / \\sigma_P\\). Substituting this into the expected return formula:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{\\sigma_P}\\]\nOr more compactly:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\nThis equation is powerful because it tells us the exact relationship between risk and expected return for our complete portfolio. Given the Sharpe ratio of our risky asset, we can immediately calculate what expected return we’ll earn for any level of risk we choose to take on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Using the CAL Equation\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you want to invest in TSLA and a risk-free asset (a 3-month T-bill). You have estimated that the Sharpe ratio of TSLA stock is 0.5. The yield on the 3-month T-bill is 0.4%. You would like the complete portfolio (made up of TSLA and the 3-month T-bill) to give you an expected return of 5.4%. What will be the total risk (standard deviation) of the complete portfolio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the CAL equation to find the standard deviation that corresponds to our target expected return.\nGiven information:\n\nSharpe ratio of TSLA = 0.5\n\\(R_f = 0.4\\%\\)\nTarget \\(E[R_C] = 5.4\\%\\)\n\nSetting up the equation:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\n\\[5.4\\% = 0.4\\% + \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\nSolving for \\(\\sigma_C\\):\n\\[5.4\\% - 0.4\\% = \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[5.0\\% = \\sigma_C \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{5.0\\%}{0.5} = 10\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nTo achieve an expected return of 5.4%, you must accept a portfolio standard deviation of 10%.\nWe can verify this makes sense by finding the implied weight in TSLA. First, we need TSLA’s volatility. Since Sharpe ratio = \\((E[R_P] - R_f)/\\sigma_P\\) and we know the Sharpe ratio is 0.5, we can work backwards: if the Sharpe ratio is 0.5 and \\(\\sigma_C = w_c \\sigma_P = 10\\%\\), then \\(w_c = \\sigma_C / \\sigma_P = 10\\% / \\sigma_P\\).\nAlternatively, using \\(E[R_C] = w_c E[R_P] + (1-w_c)R_f\\) and the fact that the excess return of 5% must come entirely from TSLA’s excess return: \\(w_c \\times (E[R_P] - R_f) = 5\\%\\), and since Sharpe ratio \\(= 0.5 = (E[R_P] - R_f)/\\sigma_P\\), we have \\((E[R_P] - R_f) = 0.5 \\sigma_P\\).\nThe key result is that the CAL tells us precisely what risk level we must accept for any given target return."

    "text": "4 Optimal Capital Allocation\nWe now know how to calculate the risk and expected return of any complete portfolio given a capital allocation weight \\(w_c\\). But this raises a crucial question: how should we choose \\(w_c\\)? The answer depends fundamentally on how the investor feels about risk.\n\n4.1 Understanding Risk Aversion\nDifferent people have different attitudes toward risk. Consider a simple thought experiment: I offer you a choice between (A) receiving $50 for certain, or (B) flipping a fair coin where you win $100 if heads and $0 if tails. Both options have the same expected value of $50, but option B involves risk while option A does not.\nMost people prefer option A—the certain $50. This preference for certainty when expected values are equal is called risk aversion. A risk-averse person requires compensation (in the form of higher expected returns) to accept risk. The more risk-averse someone is, the more compensation they demand.\nSome people might be indifferent between A and B—these are risk-neutral individuals who care only about expected value, not about risk. And a few might actually prefer B—these are risk-seeking individuals who enjoy the thrill of uncertainty.\nIn financial markets, most investors are risk-averse. This is why risky assets must offer higher expected returns than risk-free assets—the extra return is the compensation that risk-averse investors demand for bearing uncertainty.\n\n\n4.2 Quantifying Risk Aversion: The Utility Function\nTo make optimal decisions, we need a way to quantify how much an investor dislikes risk. Economists and financial theorists do this using a utility function—a mathematical function that converts portfolio characteristics into a single number representing the investor’s satisfaction or “utility.”\nThe most common utility function in finance is the mean-variance utility function (sometimes called quadratic utility):\n\\[U = E[R] - \\frac{1}{2} A \\sigma^2\\]\nHere, \\(U\\) represents the investor’s utility (satisfaction) from a portfolio with expected return \\(E[R]\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The parameter \\(A\\) is the coefficient of risk aversion—it measures how much the investor dislikes variance.\nLet’s unpack this formula. The first term, \\(E[R]\\), says that investors like higher expected returns—this increases utility. The second term, \\(-\\frac{1}{2}A\\sigma^2\\), says that investors dislike variance—this decreases utility. The coefficient \\(A\\) determines how severely variance is penalized relative to expected return.\nFor a risk-averse investor, \\(A &gt; 0\\). Higher values of \\(A\\) mean greater risk aversion—the investor penalizes variance more heavily and requires more expected return to compensate for a given level of risk. For a risk-neutral investor, \\(A = 0\\), and the utility function reduces to just the expected return. For a risk-seeking investor, \\(A &lt; 0\\), but this case is rare and not our focus.\n\n\n4.3 Interpreting the Risk Aversion Coefficient\nWhat does a risk aversion coefficient of, say, \\(A = 4\\) actually mean? One intuitive interpretation comes from thinking about certainty equivalents.\nImagine asking an investor: “If you were to invest all your wealth in a risky asset with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), what is the minimum expected return you would require to make the investment worthwhile compared to earning the risk-free rate?”\nIf the investor answers that they require an expected return of \\(E[R]\\), and they’re indifferent between this risky investment and the risk-free alternative, then their risk aversion coefficient is:\n\\[A = \\frac{E[R] - R_f}{\\sigma^2}\\]\nFor example, if an investor requires an expected return of 10% to hold an asset with variance of 0.04 (standard deviation of 20%) when the risk-free rate is 2%, their risk aversion coefficient is:\n\\[A = \\frac{0.10 - 0.02}{0.04} = \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2\\]\nCommon values of \\(A\\) in practice range from about 2 to 6, with 4 being a frequently used “moderate” value. An investor with \\(A = 2\\) is relatively tolerant of risk, while \\(A = 6\\) indicates significant risk aversion.\n\n\n4.4 Deriving the Optimal Capital Allocation\nNow we can solve for the optimal capital allocation. The investor wants to choose the weight \\(w_c\\) that maximizes their utility. Substituting our formulas for the complete portfolio into the utility function:\n\\[U = E[R_C] - \\frac{1}{2}A\\sigma_C^2\\]\n\\[U = w_c E[R_P] + (1-w_c)R_f - \\frac{1}{2}A(w_c\\sigma_P)^2\\]\n\\[U = R_f + w_c(E[R_P] - R_f) - \\frac{1}{2}Aw_c^2\\sigma_P^2\\]\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to \\(w_c\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dU}{dw_c} = (E[R_P] - R_f) - Aw_c\\sigma_P^2 = 0\\]\nSolving for \\(w_c\\) gives us the optimal capital allocation:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2}\\]\nThis elegant formula tells us exactly what proportion of our wealth to invest in the risky asset as a function of three things: the risky asset’s risk premium \\((E[R_P] - R_f)\\), the investor’s risk aversion \\((A)\\), and the risky asset’s variance \\((\\sigma_P^2)\\).\n\n\n4.5 Understanding the Optimal Allocation Formula\nThe formula makes intuitive sense on several levels. The optimal allocation to risky assets increases with the risk premium—if the expected excess return is higher, you should invest more. The allocation decreases with risk aversion—more risk-averse investors hold less in risky assets. And the allocation decreases with variance—riskier assets warrant smaller positions.\nNotice that the formula uses variance \\((\\sigma_P^2)\\) in the denominator, not standard deviation \\((\\sigma_P)\\). This is because the utility function penalizes variance, and the mathematics of optimization naturally produces this result. It means that the allocation is very sensitive to risk: doubling the standard deviation quadruples the variance and thus reduces the optimal allocation by a factor of four.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Finding the Optimal Capital Allocation\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume you have estimated that the expected return on TSLA is 5.6% and the standard deviation of its future returns is 18.6%. The risk-free rate is 0.1%. Your coefficient of risk aversion is 4. What is your optimal capital allocation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Example 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWe apply the optimal capital allocation formula directly.\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 5.6\\%\\) (expected return on TSLA)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 18.6\\%\\) (standard deviation of TSLA)\n\\(R_f = 0.1\\%\\) (risk-free rate)\n\\(A = 4\\) (coefficient of risk aversion)\n\nCalculate the variance:\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = (0.186)^2 = 0.0346\\]\nApply the optimal capital allocation formula:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.056 - 0.001}{4 \\times 0.0346}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.055}{0.1384}\\]\n\\[w^*_c = 0.397 \\approx 39.7\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nGiven your risk aversion of 4, you should invest approximately 39.7% of your wealth in TSLA and the remaining 60.3% in the risk-free asset.\nWhat would change with different risk aversion?\n\nIf \\(A = 2\\) (less risk-averse): \\(w^*_c = 0.055/(2 \\times 0.0346) = 79.5\\%\\)\nIf \\(A = 6\\) (more risk-averse): \\(w^*_c = 0.055/(6 \\times 0.0346) = 26.5\\%\\)\n\nThis illustrates how dramatically risk aversion affects the optimal allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Important Limitations\nThe optimal capital allocation formula we’ve derived assumes that the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_P\\) correctly measures the risk you’re exposed to from investing in P. This is true if P is your only investment—if your complete portfolio C represents your entire wealth.\nHowever, if you own other assets and P becomes just one component of a larger overall portfolio, the formula may not apply directly. That’s because much of P’s total risk (\\(\\sigma_P\\)) will be diversified away when combined with other assets. In that case, what matters is not P’s total risk, but its contribution to the risk of your overall portfolio—a concept we’ll explore when we study portfolio diversification.\nFor now, think of the optimal capital allocation formula as applicable when you’re deciding how to split your investable wealth between a single risky portfolio P and the risk-free asset, where P represents your entire exposure to risky assets."

    "text": "5 Key Takeaways\nThe framework we’ve developed in this lecture provides the foundation for one of the most important decisions in investing: how much risk to take. By combining a risky asset with a risk-free asset, investors can create complete portfolios anywhere along the Capital Allocation Line, trading off between the safety of the risk-free rate and the higher expected returns (but also higher volatility) of risky assets.\nThe CAL is characterized by its slope, which equals the Sharpe ratio of the risky asset. This ratio—excess return per unit of risk—serves as a universal measure of the quality of the risk-return trade-off. Higher Sharpe ratios mean steeper CALs and better investment opportunities. The CAL equation \\(E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\) allows us to translate any target expected return into the corresponding risk level, or vice versa.\nThe question of where to position yourself along the CAL depends on your risk aversion, captured by the coefficient \\(A\\) in the mean-variance utility function. This utility function formalizes the trade-off between wanting higher expected returns and disliking risk. By maximizing utility, we derived the optimal capital allocation formula, which tells us exactly what fraction of wealth to invest in risky assets given the risk premium, our risk aversion, and the asset’s variance.\nThese concepts connect to nearly everything else in investments. The Sharpe ratio will reappear when we evaluate portfolio performance and when we study how to construct the best possible risky portfolio. Risk aversion underlies asset pricing models that explain why different securities have different expected returns. And the principle of optimal capital allocation extends naturally to multi-asset portfolios, where the challenge becomes finding the best risky portfolio P before deciding how much to allocate to it."

    "text": "7 Practice Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 1: Capital Allocation Calculations\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are considering investing in an S&P 500 index fund. Based on historical data and your analysis, you estimate the expected return of the index fund to be 8% with a standard deviation of 16%. The current yield on 1-year Treasury bills is 3%. Calculate the expected return and standard deviation for complete portfolios with weights of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 125% in the index fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 1\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 8\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 16\\%\\)\n\\(R_f = 3\\%\\)\n\nApplying the formulas:\nFor each weight \\(w_c\\):\n\n\\(E[R_C] = w_c(8\\%) + (1-w_c)(3\\%)\\)\n\\(\\sigma_C = w_c(16\\%)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight (\\(w_c\\))\nExpected Return \\(E[R_C]\\)\nStandard Deviation \\(\\sigma_C\\)\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\\(0(8\\%) + 1(3\\%) = 3.0\\%\\)\n\\(0(16\\%) = 0\\%\\)\n\n\n25%\n\\(0.25(8\\%) + 0.75(3\\%) = 4.25\\%\\)\n\\(0.25(16\\%) = 4\\%\\)\n\n\n50%\n\\(0.5(8\\%) + 0.5(3\\%) = 5.5\\%\\)\n\\(0.5(16\\%) = 8\\%\\)\n\n\n75%\n\\(0.75(8\\%) + 0.25(3\\%) = 6.75\\%\\)\n\\(0.75(16\\%) = 12\\%\\)\n\n\n100%\n\\(1(8\\%) + 0(3\\%) = 8.0\\%\\)\n\\(1(16\\%) = 16\\%\\)\n\n\n125%\n\\(1.25(8\\%) - 0.25(3\\%) = 9.25\\%\\)\n\\(1.25(16\\%) = 20\\%\\)\n\n\n\nThe 125% allocation involves borrowing 25% of your wealth at the risk-free rate to invest 125% in the index fund. Notice that both expected return and standard deviation increase linearly with the weight in the risky asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 2: Using the CAL to Find Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investor is considering a diversified equity portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 0.4. The current risk-free rate is 2%. If the investor wants to achieve an expected return of 6% on their complete portfolio, what standard deviation must they accept? What if they wanted a 10% expected return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 2\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\nSharpe ratio = 0.4\n\\(R_f = 2\\%\\)\nTarget expected returns: 6% and 10%\n\nUsing the CAL equation:\n\\[E[R_C] = R_f + \\sigma_C \\times \\text{Sharpe Ratio}\\]\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\sigma_C\\):\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{E[R_C] - R_f}{\\text{Sharpe Ratio}}\\]\nFor 6% expected return:\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{6\\% - 2\\%}{0.4} = \\frac{4\\%}{0.4} = 10\\%\\]\nFor 10% expected return:\n\\[\\sigma_C = \\frac{10\\% - 2\\%}{0.4} = \\frac{8\\%}{0.4} = 20\\%\\]\nInterpretation:\nTo achieve 6% expected return, the investor must accept a 10% standard deviation. To achieve 10% expected return, they must accept 20% standard deviation—twice the risk for twice the excess return. This linear relationship is the essence of the Capital Allocation Line.\nNote that for the 10% expected return case, the investor would need to leverage (borrow at the risk-free rate) because they’re taking on more risk than the underlying risky portfolio likely has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice Problem 3: Optimal Allocation with Different Risk Aversion\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider an emerging markets equity fund with an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation of 28%. The risk-free rate is 2%. Calculate the optimal capital allocation for three investors with risk aversion coefficients of A = 2, A = 4, and A = 8. Comment on how risk aversion affects the optimal allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Practice Problem 3\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven information:\n\n\\(E[R_P] = 12\\%\\)\n\\(\\sigma_P = 28\\%\\)\n\\(R_f = 2\\%\\)\nRisk aversion coefficients: A = 2, 4, and 8\n\nCalculate the variance:\n\\[\\sigma_P^2 = (0.28)^2 = 0.0784\\]\nCalculate the risk premium:\n\\[E[R_P] - R_f = 12\\% - 2\\% = 10\\% = 0.10\\]\nApply the optimal capital allocation formula for each investor:\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{E[R_P] - R_f}{A\\sigma_P^2} = \\frac{0.10}{A \\times 0.0784}\\]\nFor A = 2 (low risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{2 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.1568} = 0.638 = 63.8\\%\\]\nFor A = 4 (moderate risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{4 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.3136} = 0.319 = 31.9\\%\\]\nFor A = 8 (high risk aversion):\n\\[w^*_c = \\frac{0.10}{8 \\times 0.0784} = \\frac{0.10}{0.6272} = 0.159 = 15.9\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Aversion (A)\nOptimal Weight in Risky Asset\nWeight in Risk-Free Asset\n\n\n\n\n2\n63.8%\n36.2%\n\n\n4\n31.9%\n68.1%\n\n\n8\n15.9%\n84.1%\n\n\n\nCommentary:\nDoubling the risk aversion coefficient exactly halves the optimal allocation to the risky asset. This is because \\(A\\) appears in the denominator of the formula. The least risk-averse investor (A = 2) allocates nearly two-thirds of their wealth to the volatile emerging markets fund, while the most risk-averse investor (A = 8) keeps more than 80% in the safety of risk-free assets. This dramatic difference illustrates why understanding your client’s (or your own) risk tolerance is so crucial for portfolio construction."

    "section": "2 Portfolio Optimization with Two Risky Assets",
    "text": "2 Portfolio Optimization with Two Risky Assets\nWe start with the simplest scenario: you have access to exactly two risky assets, which we’ll call Asset A and Asset B. To construct portfolios from these assets, you need three types of inputs that describe their risk-return characteristics. First, you need the expected returns of each asset, denoted \\(E[R_A]\\) and \\(E[R_B]\\). Second, you need a measure of each asset’s standalone risk, captured by their standard deviations \\(\\sigma_A\\) and \\(\\sigma_B\\). Third—and this is what makes portfolio theory interesting—you need to know how the two assets move together, captured by their covariance \\(\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)\\).\nThe portfolio construction problem reduces to choosing a single number: \\(w_A\\), the fraction of your portfolio invested in Asset A. Once you’ve chosen \\(w_A\\), the fraction in Asset B is automatically determined as \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\). If \\(w_A = 0.6\\), for example, you’re putting 60% of your money in Asset A and 40% in Asset B. Your goal is to find the value of \\(w_A\\) that maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio. Before we solve this optimization problem directly, it’s instructive to visualize what different portfolio combinations look like in risk-return space.\n\n2.1 The Investment Opportunity Set\nThe investment opportunity set consists of all possible portfolios you can create by varying the weights \\(w_A\\) and \\(w_B\\). Since there are infinitely many possible weight combinations, the investment opportunity set is infinite—but we can visualize its shape by computing a representative sample of portfolios.\nFor any choice of weights, the expected return and variance of the resulting portfolio are given by:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_A E[R_A] + w_B E[R_B]\\]\n\\[\\text{Var}(R_P) = w_A^2 \\text{Var}(R_A) + w_B^2 \\text{Var}(R_B) + 2 w_A w_B \\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)\\]\nwhere \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\). The portfolio’s standard deviation is simply \\(\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(R_P)}\\).\nNotice that the expected return formula is straightforward: portfolio expected return is just a weighted average of the individual expected returns. The variance formula, however, contains that crucial third term involving covariance. This is where diversification benefits come from—when assets don’t move in perfect lockstep, combining them produces a portfolio with less variance than a simple weighted average of individual variances would suggest.\nWhen we plot these portfolios with standard deviation on the horizontal axis and expected return on the vertical axis, we get a curve that typically bows to the left. This curvature represents the power of diversification: by combining assets that aren’t perfectly correlated, we can achieve risk-return combinations that would be impossible with either asset alone.\nExample 1: Constructing the Investment Opportunity Set\nYou are considering investing in Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX). Based on your analysis, you estimate that Facebook has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 20%, while Netflix has an expected return of 15% with a standard deviation of 25%. The covariance between their returns is 0.02, and the risk-free rate is 5%. Construct 21 different portfolios by varying the weight in Facebook from 0% to 100% in increments of 5%.

First, the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio (approximately 0.432) occurs around \\(w_{FB} = 40\\%\\)—neither asset alone achieves this level of risk-adjusted performance. Second, the minimum variance portfolio occurs around \\(w_{FB} = 70\\%\\), where \\(\\sigma_P \\approx 16.76\\%\\)—this is lower than either individual asset’s volatility, demonstrating the power of diversification. Third, when plotted in mean-volatility space, these portfolios trace out a curve that bows to the left, with the tangency portfolio located on the upper portion of this curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 The Optimal Risky Portfolio (Tangency Portfolio)\nThe optimal risky portfolio—the combination of Assets A and B that maximizes the Sharpe ratio—can be found analytically. The weight in Asset A that achieves this maximum is:\n\\[w_A = \\frac{(E[R_A] - R_f) \\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)}{(E[R_A] - R_f) \\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f) \\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)}\\]\nwith \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\).\nThis formula, while complex, has an intuitive structure. The numerator and denominator both involve risk premia (\\(E[R] - R_f\\)), variances, and the covariance between assets. The formula essentially balances the attractiveness of each asset (its excess return) against its contribution to portfolio risk and how it interacts with the other asset.\nWe call this the “tangency portfolio” because of its geometric interpretation. If you draw a line from the risk-free rate on the vertical axis to any point on the investment opportunity set curve, the slope of that line equals the Sharpe ratio of that portfolio. The tangency portfolio is the point where this line achieves its steepest slope—that is, where the line is tangent to the curve. This tangent line is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) for this optimal risky portfolio.\nExample 2: Finding the Tangency Portfolio\nUsing the Facebook and Netflix data from Example 1 (expected returns of 10% and 15%, standard deviations of 20% and 25%, covariance of 0.02, and risk-free rate of 5%), find the optimal combination of these two stocks. Calculate the expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of the resulting tangency portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the components of the optimal weight formula\nFirst, let’s compute the risk premia:\n\n\\(E[R_{FB}] - R_f = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05\\)\n\\(E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f = 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10\\)\n\nAnd the variance terms:\n\n\\(\\sigma_{FB}^2 = 0.20^2 = 0.04\\)\n\\(\\sigma_{NFLX}^2 = 0.25^2 = 0.0625\\)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the numerator\n\\[\\text{Numerator} = (E[R_{FB}] - R_f) \\sigma_{NFLX}^2 - (E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_{FB}, R_{NFLX})\\]\n\\[= (0.05)(0.0625) - (0.10)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.003125 - 0.002 = 0.001125\\]\nStep 3: Calculate the denominator\n\\[\\text{Denominator} = (E[R_{FB}] - R_f) \\sigma_{NFLX}^2 + (E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f) \\sigma_{FB}^2 - (E[R_{FB}] - R_f + E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_{FB}, R_{NFLX})\\]\n\\[= (0.05)(0.0625) + (0.10)(0.04) - (0.05 + 0.10)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.003125 + 0.004 - 0.003 = 0.004125\\]\nStep 4: Calculate optimal weights\n\\[w_{FB} = \\frac{0.001125}{0.004125} = 0.2727 = 27.27\\%\\]\n\\[w_{NFLX} = 1 - 0.2727 = 0.7273 = 72.73\\%\\]\nStep 5: Calculate tangency portfolio characteristics\nExpected return: \\[E[R_{tan}] = 0.2727 \\times 0.10 + 0.7273 \\times 0.15 = 0.02727 + 0.10909 = 0.1364 = 13.64\\%\\]\nVariance: \\[\\text{Var}(R_{tan}) = (0.2727)^2(0.04) + (0.7273)^2(0.0625) + 2(0.2727)(0.7273)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.00297 + 0.03305 + 0.00793 = 0.04395\\]\nStandard deviation: \\[\\sigma_{tan} = \\sqrt{0.04395} = 0.2096 = 20.96\\%\\]\nSharpe ratio: \\[\\text{Sharpe}_{tan} = \\frac{0.1364 - 0.05}{0.2096} = \\frac{0.0864}{0.2096} = 0.412\\]\nSummary: The tangency portfolio consists of 27.27% in Facebook and 72.73% in Netflix, with an expected return of 13.64%, standard deviation of 20.96%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.412. This is the highest Sharpe ratio achievable from any combination of these two stocks.\nNote that the Sharpe ratio of 0.412 matches the peak we observed in the table from Example 1, confirming our analytical solution."

    "text": "3 Portfolio Optimization with an Arbitrary Number of Risky Assets\nReal-world portfolio construction rarely involves just two assets. Investors typically have access to many stocks, bonds, and other securities. The principles we developed for two assets extend naturally to any number of assets, but the notation becomes cumbersome without matrix algebra. This section introduces the matrix representation that makes the general problem tractable.\n\n3.1 Matrix Notation for Portfolio Inputs\nSuppose we have \\(N\\) risky assets, labeled 1 through \\(N\\). We need to organize three types of information: expected returns, variances, and all pairwise covariances.\nThe expected return vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is an \\(N \\times 1\\) column vector containing each asset’s expected return:\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\begin{pmatrix} E[R_1] \\\\ E[R_2] \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ E[R_N] \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe variance-covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is an \\(N \\times N\\) matrix that captures all the variance and covariance information. The entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\) is the covariance between assets \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). When \\(i = j\\) (on the diagonal), this equals the variance of asset \\(i\\):\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Var}(R_1) & \\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Cov}(R_1, R_N) \\\\ \\text{Cov}(R_2, R_1) & \\text{Var}(R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Cov}(R_2, R_N) \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\text{Cov}(R_N, R_1) & \\text{Cov}(R_N, R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Var}(R_N) \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis matrix is symmetric because \\(\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \\text{Cov}(R_j, R_i)\\). The diagonal elements are variances (always positive), while the off-diagonal elements are covariances (which can be positive, negative, or zero).\nFor optimization, we also need the excess return vector (or risk premium vector) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\), which subtracts the risk-free rate from each expected return:\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e = \\begin{pmatrix} E[R_1] - R_f \\\\ E[R_2] - R_f \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ E[R_N] - R_f \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nFinally, we define \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) as a column vector of \\(N\\) ones, and \\(\\mathbf{1}^T\\) as its transpose (a row vector): \\(\\mathbf{1}^T = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\).\n\n\n3.2 The Tangency Portfolio with N Assets\nThe vector of portfolio weights \\(\\mathbf{w}_{tan}\\) that maximizes the Sharpe ratio is given by:\n\\[\\mathbf{w}_{tan} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e}{\\mathbf{1}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e}\\]\nLet’s unpack this formula. The numerator \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\) multiplies the inverse of the covariance matrix by the vector of excess returns. The inverse covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\) effectively “adjusts” the excess returns for the risk and correlation structure among assets. Assets that contribute less to portfolio variance (either because they’re low-volatility or because they provide diversification benefits) get higher weights relative to their excess returns.\nThe denominator \\(\\mathbf{1}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\) is a scalar—it’s just the sum of all elements in the numerator vector. Dividing by this sum ensures that the weights add up to one, as required for a properly defined portfolio.\nThis formula is elegant but requires matrix inversion, which becomes computationally intensive as \\(N\\) grows large. In practice, portfolio optimization software handles these calculations, but understanding the structure of the formula helps you interpret results and troubleshoot problems.\nThe table below summarizes the key matrix objects used in portfolio optimization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDimensions\nDescription\nElements\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nExpected return vector\n\\(E[R_i]\\) for each asset\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\)\n\\(N \\times N\\)\nVariance-covariance matrix\n\\(\\text{Var}(R_i)\\) on diagonal, \\(\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)\\) off-diagonal\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\)\n\\(N \\times N\\)\nInverse covariance matrix\nUsed to adjust for risk structure\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nExcess return vector\n\\(E[R_i] - R_f\\) for each asset\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{w}_{tan}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nTangency portfolio weights\nWeight in each asset\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{1}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nVector of ones\nUsed to sum weights\n\n\n\nExample 3: Tangency Portfolio with Three Assets\nConsider a portfolio of three stocks with the following characteristics:\n\n\n\nStock\nExpected Return\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\nA\n8%\n15%\n\n\nB\n12%\n20%\n\n\nC\n16%\n30%\n\n\n\nThe correlation matrix is:\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n\n\n\nA\n1.0\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\nB\n0.3\n1.0\n0.5\n\n\nC\n0.2\n0.5\n1.0\n\n\n\nThe risk-free rate is 4%.

    "text": "4 Key Takeaways\nPortfolio optimization addresses one of the most fundamental questions in investing: given a set of risky assets with known expected returns, volatilities, and correlations, how should you combine them to achieve the best risk-adjusted performance? The answer is the tangency portfolio—the unique combination of assets that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.\nThe journey from two assets to many assets reveals both the power and complexity of diversification. With just two assets, we can visualize the investment opportunity set as a curve in mean-volatility space, and the tangency portfolio appears where the Capital Allocation Line touches this curve at its steepest point. The optimal weight formula, while algebraically complex, yields a closed-form solution that depends on excess returns, variances, and the covariance between assets.\nWhen we extend to multiple assets, matrix algebra becomes essential. The expected returns form a vector, the variances and covariances form a symmetric matrix, and the tangency portfolio weights emerge from multiplying the inverse covariance matrix by the excess return vector. This mathematical structure reveals something profound: the optimal weights depend not just on each asset’s individual attractiveness (its excess return) but on how each asset interacts with all other assets through the covariance structure.\nPerhaps the most important insight from portfolio optimization is the separation principle: the tangency portfolio is the same for all investors, regardless of their risk tolerance. A conservative investor and an aggressive investor will both want to hold this same mix of risky assets—they differ only in how much they allocate to this risky portfolio versus the risk-free asset. This means that once you’ve identified the tangency portfolio, the only remaining decision is personal: how much risk are you willing to bear? We explore this capital allocation decision in depth in the next lecture."

    "section": "2 Portfolio Optimization with Two Risky Assets",
    "text": "2 Portfolio Optimization with Two Risky Assets\nWe start with the simplest scenario: you have access to exactly two risky assets, which we’ll call Asset A and Asset B. To construct portfolios from these assets, you need three types of inputs that describe their risk-return characteristics. First, you need the expected returns of each asset, denoted \\(E[R_A]\\) and \\(E[R_B]\\). Second, you need a measure of each asset’s standalone risk, captured by their standard deviations \\(\\sigma_A\\) and \\(\\sigma_B\\). Third—and this is what makes portfolio theory interesting—you need to know how the two assets move together, captured by their covariance \\(\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)\\).\nThe portfolio construction problem reduces to choosing a single number: \\(w_A\\), the fraction of your portfolio invested in Asset A. Once you’ve chosen \\(w_A\\), the fraction in Asset B is automatically determined as \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\). If \\(w_A = 0.6\\), for example, you’re putting 60% of your money in Asset A and 40% in Asset B. Your goal is to find the value of \\(w_A\\) that maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio. Before we solve this optimization problem directly, it’s instructive to visualize what different portfolio combinations look like in risk-return space.\n\n2.1 The Investment Opportunity Set\nThe investment opportunity set consists of all possible portfolios you can create by varying the weights \\(w_A\\) and \\(w_B\\). Since there are infinitely many possible weight combinations, the investment opportunity set is infinite—but we can visualize its shape by computing a representative sample of portfolios.\nFor any choice of weights, the expected return and variance of the resulting portfolio are given by:\n\\[E[R_P] = w_A E[R_A] + w_B E[R_B]\\]\n\\[\\text{Var}(R_P) = w_A^2 \\text{Var}(R_A) + w_B^2 \\text{Var}(R_B) + 2 w_A w_B \\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)\\]\nwhere \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\). The portfolio’s standard deviation is simply \\(\\sigma_P = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(R_P)}\\).\nNotice that the expected return formula is straightforward: portfolio expected return is just a weighted average of the individual expected returns. The variance formula, however, contains that crucial third term involving covariance. This is where diversification benefits come from—when assets don’t move in perfect lockstep, combining them produces a portfolio with less variance than a simple weighted average of individual variances would suggest.\nWhen we plot these portfolios with standard deviation on the horizontal axis and expected return on the vertical axis, we get a curve that typically bows to the left. This curvature represents the power of diversification: by combining assets that aren’t perfectly correlated, we can achieve risk-return combinations that would be impossible with either asset alone.\nExample 1: Constructing the Investment Opportunity Set\nYou are considering investing in Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX). Based on your analysis, you estimate that Facebook has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 20%, while Netflix has an expected return of 15% with a standard deviation of 25%. The covariance between their returns is 0.02, and the risk-free rate is 5%. Construct 21 different portfolios by varying the weight in Facebook from 0% to 100% in increments of 5%.

Second, the minimum variance portfolio occurs around \\(w_{FB} = 70\\%\\), where \\(\\sigma_P \\approx 16.76\\%\\)—this is lower than either individual asset’s volatility, demonstrating the power of diversification. Third, when plotted in mean-volatility space, these portfolios trace out a curve that bows to the left, with the tangency portfolio located on the upper portion of this curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 The Optimal Risky Portfolio (Tangency Portfolio)\nThe optimal risky portfolio—the combination of Assets A and B that maximizes the Sharpe ratio—can be found analytically. The weight in Asset A that achieves this maximum is:\n\\[w_A = \\frac{(E[R_A] - R_f) \\sigma_B^2 - (E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)}{(E[R_A] - R_f) \\sigma_B^2 + (E[R_B] - R_f) \\sigma_A^2 - (E[R_A] - R_f + E[R_B] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)}\\]\nwith \\(w_B = 1 - w_A\\).\nThis formula, while complex, has an intuitive structure. The numerator and denominator both involve risk premia (\\(E[R] - R_f\\)), variances, and the covariance between assets. The formula essentially balances the attractiveness of each asset (its excess return) against its contribution to portfolio risk and how it interacts with the other asset.\nWe call this the “tangency portfolio” because of its geometric interpretation. If you draw a line from the risk-free rate on the vertical axis to any point on the investment opportunity set curve, the slope of that line equals the Sharpe ratio of that portfolio. The tangency portfolio is the point where this line achieves its steepest slope—that is, where the line is tangent to the curve. This tangent line is the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) for this optimal risky portfolio.\nExample 2: Finding the Tangency Portfolio\nUsing the Facebook and Netflix data from Example 1 (expected returns of 10% and 15%, standard deviations of 20% and 25%, covariance of 0.02, and risk-free rate of 5%), find the optimal combination of these two stocks. Calculate the expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of the resulting tangency portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the components of the optimal weight formula\nFirst, let’s compute the risk premia:\n\n\\(E[R_{FB}] - R_f = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05\\)\n\\(E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f = 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10\\)\n\nAnd the variance terms:\n\n\\(\\sigma_{FB}^2 = 0.20^2 = 0.04\\)\n\\(\\sigma_{NFLX}^2 = 0.25^2 = 0.0625\\)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the numerator\n\\[\\text{Numerator} = (E[R_{FB}] - R_f) \\sigma_{NFLX}^2 - (E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_{FB}, R_{NFLX})\\]\n\\[= (0.05)(0.0625) - (0.10)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.003125 - 0.002 = 0.001125\\]\nStep 3: Calculate the denominator\n\\[\\text{Denominator} = (E[R_{FB}] - R_f) \\sigma_{NFLX}^2 + (E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f) \\sigma_{FB}^2 - (E[R_{FB}] - R_f + E[R_{NFLX}] - R_f)\\text{Cov}(R_{FB}, R_{NFLX})\\]\n\\[= (0.05)(0.0625) + (0.10)(0.04) - (0.05 + 0.10)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.003125 + 0.004 - 0.003 = 0.004125\\]\nStep 4: Calculate optimal weights\n\\[w_{FB} = \\frac{0.001125}{0.004125} = 0.2727 = 27.27\\%\\]\n\\[w_{NFLX} = 1 - 0.2727 = 0.7273 = 72.73\\%\\]\nStep 5: Calculate tangency portfolio characteristics\nExpected return: \\[E[R_{tan}] = 0.2727 \\times 0.10 + 0.7273 \\times 0.15 = 0.02727 + 0.10909 = 0.1364 = 13.64\\%\\]\nVariance: \\[\\text{Var}(R_{tan}) = (0.2727)^2(0.04) + (0.7273)^2(0.0625) + 2(0.2727)(0.7273)(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 0.00297 + 0.03305 + 0.00793 = 0.04395\\]\nStandard deviation: \\[\\sigma_{tan} = \\sqrt{0.04395} = 0.2096 = 20.96\\%\\]\nSharpe ratio: \\[\\text{Sharpe}_{tan} = \\frac{0.1364 - 0.05}{0.2096} = \\frac{0.0864}{0.2096} = 0.412\\]\nSummary: The tangency portfolio consists of 27.27% in Facebook and 72.73% in Netflix, with an expected return of 13.64%, standard deviation of 20.96%, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.412. This is the highest Sharpe ratio achievable from any combination of these two stocks.\nNote that the Sharpe ratio of 0.412 matches the peak we observed in the table from Example 1, confirming our analytical solution."

    "text": "3 Portfolio Optimization with an Arbitrary Number of Risky Assets\nReal-world portfolio construction rarely involves just two assets. Investors typically have access to many stocks, bonds, and other securities. The principles we developed for two assets extend naturally to any number of assets, but the notation becomes cumbersome without matrix algebra. This section introduces the matrix representation that makes the general problem tractable.\n\n3.1 Matrix Notation for Portfolio Inputs\nSuppose we have \\(N\\) risky assets, labeled 1 through \\(N\\). We need to organize three types of information: expected returns, variances, and all pairwise covariances.\nThe expected return vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is an \\(N \\times 1\\) column vector containing each asset’s expected return:\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\begin{pmatrix} E[R_1] \\\\ E[R_2] \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ E[R_N] \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe variance-covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is an \\(N \\times N\\) matrix that captures all the variance and covariance information. The entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\) is the covariance between assets \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). When \\(i = j\\) (on the diagonal), this equals the variance of asset \\(i\\):\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Var}(R_1) & \\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Cov}(R_1, R_N) \\\\ \\text{Cov}(R_2, R_1) & \\text{Var}(R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Cov}(R_2, R_N) \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\text{Cov}(R_N, R_1) & \\text{Cov}(R_N, R_2) & \\cdots & \\text{Var}(R_N) \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis matrix is symmetric because \\(\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \\text{Cov}(R_j, R_i)\\). The diagonal elements are variances (always positive), while the off-diagonal elements are covariances (which can be positive, negative, or zero).\nFor optimization, we also need the excess return vector (or risk premium vector) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\), which subtracts the risk-free rate from each expected return:\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e = \\begin{pmatrix} E[R_1] - R_f \\\\ E[R_2] - R_f \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ E[R_N] - R_f \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nFinally, we define \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) as a column vector of \\(N\\) ones, and \\(\\mathbf{1}^T\\) as its transpose (a row vector): \\(\\mathbf{1}^T = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)\\).\n\n\n3.2 The Tangency Portfolio with N Assets\nThe vector of portfolio weights \\(\\mathbf{w}_{tan}\\) that maximizes the Sharpe ratio is given by:\n\\[\\mathbf{w}_{tan} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e}{\\mathbf{1}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e}\\]\nLet’s unpack this formula. The numerator \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\) multiplies the inverse of the covariance matrix by the vector of excess returns. The inverse covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\) effectively “adjusts” the excess returns for the risk and correlation structure among assets. Assets that contribute less to portfolio variance (either because they’re low-volatility or because they provide diversification benefits) get higher weights relative to their excess returns.\nThe denominator \\(\\mathbf{1}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\) is a scalar—it’s just the sum of all elements in the numerator vector. Dividing by this sum ensures that the weights add up to one, as required for a properly defined portfolio.\nThis formula is elegant but requires matrix inversion, which becomes computationally intensive as \\(N\\) grows large. In practice, portfolio optimization software handles these calculations, but understanding the structure of the formula helps you interpret results and troubleshoot problems.\nThe table below summarizes the key matrix objects used in portfolio optimization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nDimensions\nDescription\nElements\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nExpected return vector\n\\(E[R_i]\\) for each asset\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\)\n\\(N \\times N\\)\nVariance-covariance matrix\n\\(\\text{Var}(R_i)\\) on diagonal, \\(\\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)\\) off-diagonal\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}\\)\n\\(N \\times N\\)\nInverse covariance matrix\nUsed to adjust for risk structure\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^e\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nExcess return vector\n\\(E[R_i] - R_f\\) for each asset\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{w}_{tan}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nTangency portfolio weights\nWeight in each asset\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{1}\\)\n\\(N \\times 1\\)\nVector of ones\nUsed to sum weights\n\n\n\nExample 3: Tangency Portfolio with Three Assets\nConsider a portfolio of three stocks with the following characteristics:\n\n\n\nStock\nExpected Return\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\nA\n8%\n15%\n\n\nB\n12%\n20%\n\n\nC\n16%\n30%\n\n\n\nThe correlation matrix is:\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n\n\n\nA\n1.0\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\nB\n0.3\n1.0\n0.5\n\n\nC\n0.2\n0.5\n1.0\n\n\n\nThe risk-free rate is 4%.

    "text": "4 Key Takeaways\nPortfolio optimization addresses one of the most fundamental questions in investing: given a set of risky assets with known expected returns, volatilities, and correlations, how should you combine them to achieve the best risk-adjusted performance? The answer is the tangency portfolio—the unique combination of assets that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.\nThe journey from two assets to many assets reveals both the power and complexity of diversification. With just two assets, we can visualize the investment opportunity set as a curve in mean-volatility space, and the tangency portfolio appears where the Capital Allocation Line touches this curve at its steepest point. The optimal weight formula, while algebraically complex, yields a closed-form solution that depends on excess returns, variances, and the covariance between assets.\nWhen we extend to multiple assets, matrix algebra becomes essential. The expected returns form a vector, the variances and covariances form a symmetric matrix, and the tangency portfolio weights emerge from multiplying the inverse covariance matrix by the excess return vector. This mathematical structure reveals something profound: the optimal weights depend not just on each asset’s individual attractiveness (its excess return) but on how each asset interacts with all other assets through the covariance structure.\nPerhaps the most important insight from portfolio optimization is the separation principle: the tangency portfolio is the same for all investors, regardless of their risk tolerance. A conservative investor and an aggressive investor will both want to hold this same mix of risky assets—they differ only in how much they allocate to this risky portfolio versus the risk-free asset. This means that once you’ve identified the tangency portfolio, the only remaining decision is personal: how much risk are you willing to bear? We explore this capital allocation decision in depth in the next lecture."

    "text": "7 Ask an LLM\nHere are three questions you might ask an AI assistant to deepen your understanding of these concepts:\n\nCan you walk me through an intuitive explanation of why the tangency portfolio is the same for all investors regardless of their risk aversion? What assumptions are required for this result to hold?\nHow would the tangency portfolio weights change if one asset’s correlation with the others suddenly increased? Can you give me a numerical example showing this effect?\nIn practice, we estimate expected returns and covariances from historical data, which introduces estimation error. How sensitive is the tangency portfolio to errors in these inputs, and what techniques do practitioners use to make portfolio optimization more robust?\nWhat happens to the tangency portfolio formula if one of the assets is the risk-free asset? Can you show mathematically why this creates a problem and how it relates to the Capital Market Line?\nHow does the number of assets in a portfolio affect the benefits of diversification? Is there a point of diminishing returns, and if so, why?"
