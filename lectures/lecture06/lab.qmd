- Under Step 1, choose date range 1926-07 to 2023-12
- Under Step 2, select 'mktrf' (these are excess returns on the market portfolio) and 'rf' (this is the yield on a 1 month tbill)
- Under Step 3, select 'Excel spreadsheet' and 'Uncompressed'

Using this data:

- Calculate monthly market returns by adding the risk free rate (rf) to the excess return on the market (mktrf)
- Assume the risk-free rate is 0.4% and your risk aversion coefficient is 4. What is your optimal capital allocation between the risk free asset and the market portfolio?
