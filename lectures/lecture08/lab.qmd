You want to invest in the FANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google) but you are not sure how much to invest in each. 

Download monthly stock returns from WRDS on the FANG stocks from 2019 to 2023 (tickers are FB, AAPL, NFLX, and GOOGL). 

Assume that the risk-free rate is 0.4% and your risk aversion coefficient is 4.

Use these data to estimate the optimal weights you should use for the four stocks and in the risk-free asset (i.e. the weight of each asset in the optimal complete portfolio).
