# Introduction

Investment decisions fundamentally involve a trade-off between risk and expected return. This chapter provides the essential tools for measuring both, drawing insights from historical data while acknowledging the limitations of using the past to forecast the future. The "black swan" problem—the possibility that future events may be worse (or better) than anything we've observed historically—should always temper our confidence in historical estimates.

# Interest Rates: The Foundation

## Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates

When we talk about interest rates, we need to distinguish between the **nominal rate** (the growth rate of your money) and the **real rate** (the growth rate of your purchasing power). If inflation erodes the value of money, your real return is less than your nominal return.

The approximate relationship is simple:

$$r_r \approx r_n - i$$

where $r_r$ is the real rate, $r_n$ is the nominal rate, and $i$ is the inflation rate.

The exact relationship is:

$$1 + r_r = \frac{1 + r_n}{1 + i} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_r = \frac{r_n - i}{1 + i}$$

The approximation works well when inflation is low but overstates the real rate when inflation is high.

::: {.callout-note}
## The Fisher Equation
Irving Fisher argued that nominal rates should increase one-for-one with expected inflation:
$$r_n = r_r + E(i)$$
This implies that when real rates are stable, changes in nominal rates predict changes in inflation.

### Example: Real Rate Calculation

A 1-year CD offers a nominal rate of 8%. You expect inflation to be 5% over the coming year. What is your expected real rate of return using both the approximation and the exact formula?

### Solution

**Approximation:**
$$r_r \approx 8\% - 5\% = 3\%$$

**Exact formula:**
$$r_r = \frac{0.08 - 0.05}{1 + 0.05} = \frac{0.03}{1.05} = 0.0286 = 2.86\%$$

The approximation overstates the real rate by 14 basis points (0.14%).
:::

## What Determines Interest Rates?

The equilibrium real interest rate depends on three factors:

- **Supply of funds** from household savings (upward-sloping: higher rates encourage more saving)
- **Demand for funds** from businesses for capital investment (downward-sloping: lower rates make more projects viable)
- **Government policy** through fiscal deficits (shifting demand) and monetary policy (shifting supply)

# Comparing Returns Across Different Horizons

## Effective Annual Rate (EAR) and APR

When investments have different holding periods, we need a common basis for comparison. The **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** tells us the equivalent annual return accounting for compounding.

Given a total return $r_f(T)$ over a period of length $T$ years:

$$1 + EAR = [1 + r_f(T)]^{1/T}$$

The **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** is simpler—it's just the per-period rate multiplied by the number of periods per year, ignoring compounding:

$$APR = n \times r_f(T) \quad \text{where } n = 1/T$$

The relationship between EAR and APR:

$$1 + EAR = \left(1 + \frac{APR}{n}\right)^n = (1 + T \times APR)^{1/T}$$

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Example: EAR vs. APR

A 6-month Treasury bill has a total return of 2.71%. Calculate the APR and EAR.

### Solution

**APR:** With $T = 0.5$ years, there are $n = 2$ compounding periods per year:
$$APR = 2 \times 2.71\% = 5.42\%$$

**EAR:** Compounding the 6-month return over two periods:
$$1 + EAR = (1.0271)^2 = 1.0549$$
$$EAR = 5.49\%$$

The EAR exceeds the APR because it accounts for the compounding of returns.
:::

## Continuous Compounding

As compounding becomes more frequent, we approach **continuous compounding**. The continuously compounded rate $r_{cc}$ relates to EAR as:

$$1 + EAR = e^{r_{cc}}$$

To convert: $r_{cc} = \ln(1 + EAR)$

A key advantage of continuous compounding: the relationship between real and nominal rates becomes exact:
$$r_{cc}^{real} = r_{cc}^{nominal} - i_{cc}$$

# Measuring Risk and Return

## Holding Period Return (HPR)

The holding period return captures both price appreciation and income:

$$HPR = \frac{\text{Ending Price} - \text{Beginning Price} + \text{Cash Dividend}}{\text{Beginning Price}}$$

## Expected Return and Standard Deviation

Given a set of scenarios with probabilities $p(s)$ and returns $r(s)$, the expected return is:

$$E(r) = \sum_s p(s) \cdot r(s)$$

The variance measures the expected squared deviation from the mean:

$$\sigma^2 = \sum_s p(s) \cdot [r(s) - E(r)]^2$$

The **standard deviation** $\sigma$ is the square root of variance and is our primary measure of risk.

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Example: Portfolio Risk and Return

You're analyzing a stock index fund with the following scenario analysis:

| State | Probability | HPR |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Excellent | 0.25 | 31% |
| Good | 0.45 | 14% |
| Poor | 0.25 | -6.75% |
| Crash | 0.05 | -52% |

Calculate the expected return and standard deviation.

### Solution

**Expected Return:**
$$E(r) = (0.25)(0.31) + (0.45)(0.14) + (0.25)(-0.0675) + (0.05)(-0.52)$$
$$E(r) = 0.0775 + 0.063 - 0.0169 - 0.026 = 0.0976 = 9.76\%$$

**Variance:**
$$\sigma^2 = 0.25(0.31-0.0976)^2 + 0.45(0.14-0.0976)^2 + 0.25(-0.0675-0.0976)^2 + 0.05(-0.52-0.0976)^2$$
$$\sigma^2 = 0.25(0.0451) + 0.45(0.0018) + 0.25(0.0273) + 0.05(0.3815)$$
$$\sigma^2 = 0.0113 + 0.0008 + 0.0068 + 0.0191 = 0.0380$$

**Standard Deviation:**
$$\sigma = \sqrt{0.0380} = 0.1949 = 19.49\%$$
:::

## Risk Premium and Sharpe Ratio

The **risk premium** is the expected return above the risk-free rate:
$$\text{Risk Premium} = E(r) - r_f$$

The **Sharpe ratio** measures reward per unit of risk:
$$\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(r) - r_f}{\sigma}$$

This is the single most important measure of portfolio performance. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Example: Sharpe Ratio

Using the portfolio from the previous example with $E(r) = 9.76\%$, $\sigma = 19.49\%$, and assuming a risk-free rate of 4%, calculate the risk premium and Sharpe ratio.

### Solution

**Risk Premium:**
$$E(r) - r_f = 9.76\% - 4\% = 5.76\%$$

**Sharpe Ratio:**
$$SR = \frac{5.76\%}{19.49\%} = 0.30$$

A Sharpe ratio of 0.30 is roughly in line with historical stock market performance.

# Time Series Analysis

## Arithmetic vs. Geometric Average

When analyzing historical returns, we encounter two types of averages:

**Arithmetic average:** Simply the mean of observed returns
$$\bar{r} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n} r_t$$

**Geometric average:** The constant return that would produce the same terminal wealth
$$(1+g)^n = (1+r_1)(1+r_2)\cdots(1+r_n)$$
$$g = \left[\prod_{t=1}^{n}(1+r_t)\right]^{1/n} - 1$$

The arithmetic average is an unbiased estimator of expected future returns. The geometric average tells us actual historical performance.

**Key relationship:** For normally distributed returns,
$$E[\text{Geometric Average}] \approx E[\text{Arithmetic Average}] - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2$$

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Example: Arithmetic vs. Geometric Average

A portfolio has the following annual returns: -22.10%, +28.69%, +10.88%, +4.91%. Calculate both averages.

### Solution

**Arithmetic Average:**
$$\bar{r} = \frac{-0.2210 + 0.2869 + 0.1088 + 0.0491}{4} = \frac{0.2238}{4} = 0.056 = 5.6\%$$

**Geometric Average:**
$$(1+g)^4 = (0.7790)(1.2869)(1.1088)(1.0491) = 1.1667$$
$$1+g = 1.1667^{0.25} = 1.0393$$
$$g = 3.93\%$$

The geometric average is lower because negative returns have an asymmetric impact on wealth. After losing 22.10%, you need a 28.4% gain just to break even—not 22.10%.
:::

# The Normal Distribution and Deviations from It

## Why Normality Matters

The normal distribution is central to investment analysis because:

1. **Symmetry:** Positive and negative deviations from the mean are equally likely
2. **Stability:** Portfolios of normally distributed assets are also normally distributed
3. **Simplicity:** Only two parameters (mean and SD) fully describe the distribution
4. **Dependence:** Correlation alone captures the relationship between assets

## Deviations from Normality

Real returns often deviate from normality in important ways:

**Skewness** measures asymmetry:
$$\text{Skew} = \text{Average}\left[\frac{(R-\bar{R})^3}{\hat{\sigma}^3}\right]$$

- Positive skew: Long right tail (extreme positive outcomes more likely)
- Negative skew: Long left tail (extreme negative outcomes more likely—more concerning for investors)

**Kurtosis** measures "fat tails":
$$\text{Kurtosis} = \text{Average}\left[\frac{(R-\bar{R})^4}{\hat{\sigma}^4}\right] - 3$$

- Kurtosis > 0: Fatter tails than normal (more extreme events)
- Kurtosis = 0: Normal distribution

## Measuring Tail Risk

When returns aren't normal, standard deviation may understate risk. Alternative measures include:

**Value at Risk (VaR):** The loss at a specified percentile (e.g., 5% VaR is the return at the 5th percentile—95% of outcomes are better). For a normal distribution:
$$VaR(5\%) = \text{Mean} - 1.65 \times SD$$

**Expected Shortfall (ES):** The expected loss given that you're in the tail. This is more informative than VaR because it considers the magnitude of extreme losses, not just their threshold.

**Lower Partial Standard Deviation (LPSD):** Standard deviation calculated using only negative excess returns. The ratio of risk premium to LPSD is called the **Sortino ratio**—a variant of the Sharpe ratio that focuses on downside risk.

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Example: VaR Calculation

A portfolio has an expected monthly return of 1% and standard deviation of 6%. What is the 5% VaR assuming normality? What is the probability of a negative return?

### Solution

**5% VaR (assuming normality):**
$$VaR(5\%) = 1\% - 1.65 \times 6\% = 1\% - 9.9\% = -8.9\%$$

There's a 5% chance of losing more than 8.9% in a month.

**Probability of negative return:**
A negative return is 0 - 1% = -1%, which is $\frac{-1\%}{6\%} = -0.167$ standard deviations below the mean.

Using Excel: =NORMSDIST(-0.167) = 0.4338

There's a 43.4% probability of a negative monthly return.

# Historical Evidence

## Key Findings from U.S. History (1926-2012)

The historical record provides benchmarks for risk and return:

| Asset Class | Average Excess Return | Standard Deviation | Sharpe Ratio |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| All U.S. Stocks (value-weighted) | 7.52% | 20.46% | 0.37 |
| Big/Value | 12.34% | 29.25% | 0.42 |
| Big/Growth | 10.98% | 20.79% | 0.53 |
| Small/Value | 26.28% | 41.41% | 0.63 |

**Key observations:**

- Small stocks earned higher returns but with much higher volatility
- Value stocks (high book-to-market) outperformed growth stocks
- The Sharpe ratio for broad market indices has been around 0.3-0.4
- Returns exhibit fat tails—extreme events are more common than the normal distribution predicts

# Long-Term Investments: A Word of Caution

A common misconception is that stocks become "safer" over longer horizons because the probability of underperforming T-bills declines. While true, this reasoning is flawed because it ignores the **magnitude** of potential losses.

As your horizon extends:

- Expected cumulative return grows proportionally with time
- Standard deviation of cumulative return grows with the square root of time
- The Sharpe ratio of cumulative returns increases with $\sqrt{T}$

However, worst-case outcomes become increasingly severe. The cost of insuring a portfolio against shortfall actually *increases* with the investment horizon—the opposite of what we'd expect if stocks were truly safer in the long run.

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Black Swan Problem
No matter how long our historical record, we cannot rule out future events worse than anything previously observed. This is especially concerning for long-term investments where compounding can magnify both gains and losses.

# Practice Problems

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Problem 1

The nominal interest rate is 7% and expected inflation is 4%. Calculate the exact real interest rate and compare it to the approximation.

### Solution 1

**Approximation:** $r_r \approx 7\% - 4\% = 3\%$

**Exact:** $r_r = \frac{0.07 - 0.04}{1.04} = \frac{0.03}{1.04} = 2.88\%$

The approximation overstates the real rate by 12 basis points.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Problem 2

A 3-month T-bill offers a total return of 1.5%. What is the EAR and APR?

### Solution 2

**APR:** $4 \times 1.5\% = 6\%$

**EAR:** $(1.015)^4 - 1 = 1.0614 - 1 = 6.14\%$
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Problem 3

A risky portfolio has an expected return of 12%, standard deviation of 25%, and the risk-free rate is 3%. What is the Sharpe ratio? If the portfolio also has a lower partial standard deviation (LPSD) of 30%, what is the Sortino ratio?

### Solution 3

**Sharpe Ratio:** $\frac{12\% - 3\%}{25\%} = \frac{9\%}{25\%} = 0.36$

**Sortino Ratio:** $\frac{12\% - 3\%}{30\%} = \frac{9\%}{30\%} = 0.30$

The Sortino ratio is lower, reflecting greater downside volatility.
