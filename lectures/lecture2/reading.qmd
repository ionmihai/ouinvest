## Pre-class Reading

### Required Reading

Please complete the following reading before class:

- Chapter 2: Risk and Return
- Focus on the mathematical foundations

### Key Concepts

1. **Expected Return**: The probability-weighted average of possible returns.

2. **Variance**: A measure of the dispersion of returns around the expected value.

3. **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance; a common measure of risk.

4. **Diversification**: The strategy of reducing risk by investing in multiple assets.

### Formulas

Expected Return:
$$E(R) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot R_i$$

Variance:
$$\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot (R_i - E(R))^2$$

### Discussion Questions

1. Why is standard deviation a useful measure of risk?
2. How does diversification reduce portfolio risk?
